&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you own property For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you own <a href="future.htm">future</a> goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,<br/>
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.<br/>
<br/>
There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.<br/>
And profit does not exist when there is no sale.<br/>
<br/>
The price each pays as a consumer is the costs<br/>
that same person paid as owner and the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
itself becomes the natural return on investment.<br/>
<br/>
Paying others for <a href="work.htm">work</a> is a cost of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
But every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is a consumer needing Property.<br/>
<br/>
So Promises become Property as <a href="work.htm">work</a> is finished.<br/>
This protects <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from paying consumer rent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This strange arrangemet 'preallocates' <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts to the people who know they will need them and eliminates the need to sell those commodities in the traditional sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit does not exist because purchase simply does not occur.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who promise <a href="future.htm">future</a> labor receive immediate access to debt-free property on a <a href="work.htm">work</a>-to-own basis. This means <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers gain real property ownership incrementally, as they fulfill <a href="work.htm">work</a> promises.<br/>
<br/>
Each co-owner may decide some of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they own is more than they want, and so declare it as 'surplus' to be sold to consumers with insufficient ownership.<br/>
<br/>
The market sets the price when selling surplus, but some minimum % of profit must be treated as the payer's investment. This causes those who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create <a href="future.htm">future</a> instances of that kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.<br/>
