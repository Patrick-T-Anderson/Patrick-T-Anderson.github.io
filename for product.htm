&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not buy, when you own it already!<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you own property For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you own the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BECAUSE you own the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es<br/>
<br/>
Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,<br/>
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.<br/>
<br/>
You own the outputs because you own the inputs.<br/>
<br/>
There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.<br/>
And profit does not exist when there is no sale.<br/>
<br/>
The price each pays as a consumer is the costs<br/>
that same person paid as owner and the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
itself becomes the natural return on investment.<br/>
<br/>
Paying others for <a href="work.htm">work</a> is a cost of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
But every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is a consumer needing Property.<br/>
<br/>
So Promises become Property as <a href="work.htm">work</a> is finished.<br/>
This protects <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from paying consumer rent.<br/>
<br/>
This strange arrangement preallocates <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts<br/>
<br/>
to those people who know they will need them<br/>
eliminates the sale in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
Profit does not exist when there is no sale.<br/>
<br/>
Commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> to receive immediate access to property that vests incrementally as those promises are completed.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner may retain all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and never declare surplus.<br/>
<br/>
If surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are sold, a % of that profit must be treated as the payer's investment.<br/>
<br/>
causing those payers to slowly gain property in the land and tools needed to create <a href="future.htm">future</a> instances of that kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.<br/>
