2022-11-22: A review of WorkAdventu.re after watching youtube.com/watch?v=h7UqvALMONs

I like the idea of interaction-by-proximity,
but want a more careful and gentle approach.

So, instead suddenly switching from nothing to a full meeting,
each client sends very low res video and very low volume audio
whenever they are within line-of-site to another player.

The a/v quality of each player increases as they approach you.

Imagine you shut the door of your windowed office.
Video would be sent whenever line-of-site is met,
but audio would only be sent if the other player
pressed their ear against your door üòÅ

2022-11-12: Rant au Rest - Play to Own, Own for Goods
A Free as in Freedom production arena structured by a remixing of:

The GNU GPL Copyright License: Users must gain ownership in the Sources {land, water, plants, etc.} required to create and maintain the Products {goods and services} they use.

Zero-Copy networking, Bit-Blit: You do not buy that which you already own.  If the Product User is the Source Owner, there is NO SALE.

Crowd Funding, Halal Finance, Prepaid, Subscription: You may pay with Money, but we may charge Profit, Rent, or Interest.  Some of those financial returns *must* be invested for you, the paying user, so you also gain Sources.  This safely drives Profit, Rent and Interest toward zero for those owners.

Harberger Tax, Land Value Tax, Georgists, Geoists: With intentions similar to the GNU GPL, these proposals also address the hoarding of crucial Sources (Means of Production).  Instead of collecting tax, we reflect value as land ownership.

OpenSourceEcology.org and many others...

You may:
. Find Land (Propose real-estate listings)
. Bind Work (Sign Skill_Contracts)
. Gain Land (Source_Titles vest to you)

When Mario pulls a root from the land...
Where is the Banker to take his claim?

Money may seem to be better than fruit,
because fruit rots, and money does not.

But Money is not Value, it can only *Point* at Value.
It is like a "Void Pointer" in the 'C' programming language.

The magic of a "Void Pointer" is that it may represent any Type of value.
In the real world, there are many layers to the many Types.  You might say there are many Types of Types.

The For_Product model identifies 4 Value Types:
Product: (finished good or service): Apple, Orange, Taxi ride, Dental exam
Sources: The many material inputs of production, such as land, water, seeds, spores
Skills: The human thought and effort required to transform Sources into Products.
