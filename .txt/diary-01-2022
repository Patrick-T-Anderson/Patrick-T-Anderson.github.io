Wow, so after all of that effort to install Chromium without `snap` package manager, Google has disabled "Account Sync" on Chromium, so all passwords are missing.

cd Downloads
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

>>> Myco makes money by charging a 10% royalty on all profits which the Co's distribute to their points-holders.

Hmm, but if Profit is the price each User pays,
above the real costs the Owners have paid,
When Users are the Owners, Profit is 0!

But production requires both Land and Work.

So if we can Own Land to Own Products,
then Trade Work to make it all happen,
we can ensure the production we need.
