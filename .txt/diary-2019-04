Earth Change storyboard:

1. Past failures: A better way to share property, swap skills and issue currency.
2. Overproduction: The Crisis of Capitalism, The Origin of Profit, The Purpose of Property, The Grapes of Wrath, Artificial Scarcity.
3. Permaculture creates local, circular and almost free food, shelter, medicine, textiles.
4. Property Ownership: Stallman vs. Marx and the For Product investment model.
5. As promises are completed, workers receive the property they need to avoid debt.
6. Hippy-Monster DAO issues and sells tokens to build and maintain Free as in Freedom production.
