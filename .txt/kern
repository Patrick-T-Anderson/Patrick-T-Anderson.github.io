# "'Consider a sandwich, for instance. You might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either gratis or for a price. If so, the amount you pay is the only difference. Whether or not you have to buy it, the sandwich has the same taste, the same nutritional value, and in either case you can only eat it once.

This is true for any kind of material objectâ€”whether or not it has an owner does not directly affect what it is, or what you can do with it if you acquire it.'" -- GNU.org/philosophy/why-free.en.html

The material Sources of a sandwich are the physical supply chains required to produce all of those ingredients.

If the robots were here, users could own future sandwiches by simply owning the material Sources required for that production.

For now we can schedule future work.
