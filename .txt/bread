## A language and construction kit for Economic Kernel development.
The purpose of an "Economic Kernel" is to structure real world PRODUCTION.

## Definitions
PRODUCTION: Mixing SOURCES with WORK to create GOODS and SERVICES.
TICKET: A legally-binding agreement representing a finished GOOD or SERVICE at a projected quantity and quality, usually within a strict window-of-time.  TICKETS are like 'semi-fungible' Tokens.  For example, a dozen, organic, free-range, large, heirloom grade AA eggs are mostly interchangable with any other dozen with those same characteristics.

SOURCES: Land, Water, Minerals, Organisms, Tools, etc.
TITLE: A legally-binding agreement of Property Ownership of SOURCES (or simulated ownership where private property is not allowed by the containing government).

WORK: Part of the human effort required for PRODUCTION.
CONTRACT: A legally-binding agreement to achieve future WORK

GOOD: A finished tangible Product, such as an Apple.
SERVICE: A finished human action, such as picking Apples.

MONEY: A Fungible Token system
WAGES: MONEY flowing from OWNERS to WORKERS.
PROFIT: MONEY flowing from USERS to OWNERS.

USE: Exclusive but temporary access to a finished GOOD or SERVICE.
USER: Not every USER is a WORKER, some USER SOURCES.
WORKER: Every WORKER is a USER of *many* GOODS and SERVICES!

## Start
BOOT: Buy SOURCES with OPTION{Debt, Equity, Sell NFT, Sell Coin}
WORK: Collect OPTION{WAGES, GOODS, SERVICES, SOURCES}
VEST: Transfer SOURCES with OPTION{to those who paid with MONEY, to those who paid with WORK}
HOLD: OWN SOURCES to collect OPTION{Profit, Product}
