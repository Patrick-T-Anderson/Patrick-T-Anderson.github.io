I wondered how ants organized their societies.  Each colony was so productive and peaceful.  How did they plan their lives and homes?  Did they have religion and government?

Meanwhile I saw most people work so hard for so little while others gained too much with almost no effort.

Later I found Richard Stallman's tricky Copyright license requires every user gain access to the Sources of the Products they use.  Sources are akin to the Means of Production in the virtual realm.

It seemed like such an odd requirement.  Few users want to operate the Sources, so what was the point?

It turns out this arrangement allows the worker to access the Means of Production with nearly zero barrier-to-entry.
