I've been working on a new way to organize production.

The GNU GPL trade agreement requires every user gain access to the Sources of the products they use.  Sources are essentially the Means of Production.  But most users don't care about the Sources, so what is the point?...

Then I saw Henry George's proposal to solve the rent problem by changing how groups collect funding and realized the purpose is similar to the goals of the GNU GPL since rent disappears (or is imputed) when the User is the Owner.

Product-Futures-Foundation.github.io is my attempt to remix these patterns to build and maintain a series of privately owned, Free as in Freedom cities under the direct control of those citizen-owners.
