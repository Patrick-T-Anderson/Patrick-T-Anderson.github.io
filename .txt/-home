As a child, I wondered how ants organized society.

Each ant in every colony seemed to have enough food and shelter,
yet there were so many humans going without these basic needs.

How were the ants able to do what we could not?
As I grew older I thought more about this problem.

I started playing the game myself and knew something was wrong, but what was it?

...

Later I noticed the GNU GPL enforces a very strange trade agreement.
It requires every user gain access to the Sources of that Product.
Sources are essentially the Means of Production in the virtual realm.
But few users would ever try to operate the Sources, so what was the point?...

Then I saw Henry George's proposal to solve the rent problem by changing how groups collect funding.

And realized the purpose is similar to the goals of the GNU GPL since rent becomes 0 (or imputed) when the User is the Owner.

Product-Futures-Foundation.github.io is my shot at using these patterns to create a series of privately owned, Free as in Freedom cities under the full and direct dominion of those citizen-owners.
