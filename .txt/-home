As a child, I wondered how ants organized society so each had plenty,
while the TV showed fly-covered children clenching empty steel bowls.

The TV asked for money to help but surely the ants didn't have money.

                                ...

Later I discovered the GNU GPL Copyright license
and pondered how it seemed related to that issue.

This strange legal instrument requires every product user
gain "at cost" access to the Sources of that production.

But most users want nothing to do with Sources, so why insure access?

I thought about this for years.  What a curious idea.
It would be like gaining üå≥ whenever you eat üçé.
But owners cannot just give away Sources,
so where could this value come from?

                                ...

Meanwhile, I learned about some problems in economics.
I eventually saw this could work if the tree owner
used some of the profit you paid for those fruits
to buy even more land and trees and water-rights
required to grow even more fruit in the future
and 'vest' those shares to you, the consumer.
This arrangement incrementally eliminates
the usual need to purchase those goods.

"'
    The owner of a tree does not buy that fruit,
    he owns it even before it has been picked!
'"

This also reduces barrier-to-entry
and promotes real permanence.

                ...

Ahh, but what about the poor workers?

Well, every worker is also a consumer who
needs Source ownership for the same reason.

We can use property rights and contract law
to build a GNU system where each has plenty
and controlled by those who need the results.
