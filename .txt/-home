As a child, I wondered how ants organized society so each had plenty
while the TV showed fly-covered children clenching empty steel bowls.

The TV asked for money to help but surely the ants didn't have money.

Later I began reading and pondering the strange GNU GPL copyright license.
It requires every user gain access to the sources of the products they use.
But most users don't care about the sources, so why would they need access?

I thought about this for years.  What a curious idea.
It would be like gaining property ownership in a fruit tree when you buy that fruit.
This could work if the owners used some of the profit you paid to buy even more land and trees and water-rights, etc. required to grow more fruit in the future and 'vest' those shares to you, the consumer.

I finally realized this arrangement eventually eliminates the usual need to buy those goods.
The owner of a fruit tree does not buy fruit, he owns it before it is even created!
Even if others do all the work, there is no sale, and so no profit.
This also reduces barrier-to-entry and promotes long term solutions.

                                ...

Hmm, but what about the poor workers?  Well every worker is also a consumer.
They can gain property ownership in the sources by trading services early.
This reduces the perceived need for jobs and promotes long term solutions.
