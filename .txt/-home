As a child, I wondered how ants organized society so each had plenty,
while the TV showed fly-covered children clenching empty steel bowls.

The TV asked for money to help but surely the ants didn't have money.

Later I discovered GNU GPL Copyright license.

This odd legal instrument requires every product user
gain access to the immaterial Sources of production.

But most users will never use the Sources, so why insure access?

I thought about this for years.  What a curious idea.

It would be like gaining Treesüå≥ when you buy Fruitüçé.

Well, owners cannot just give away their Treesüå≥...

Hmm, but they could buy Land with some Profit,
then vest that Land to those who bought Fruitüçé.

This profit-sharing strategy, inspired by the GNU GPL,
brings User Freedom to the material world.

    A Supply Chain Game

# Goal
The local production of all essential Goods and Services.

# Value Types
INPUTS: Land, Work
OUTPUTS: Goods, Services

# Legal Instruments
DEED: Expiring access to a specific portion of Land. [INPUT]
CONTRACT: Expiring commitment to fulfill a specific kind of future Work. [INPUT]
TICKET: Expiring coupon redeemable for a specific kind of future Good or Service. [OUTPUT]

# Monetary Instruments
COIN: Non-expiring fungible token limited in supply by the number of square meters of land held under these terms.

# Social Agreements
BASIC_OUTCOME: A bundle of TICKETS representing the essential Goods and Services every individual must have, as defined by this Group.

# How to Play
PAY-TO-PLAY: Buy COINS to fund production.

SIGN-TO-STAY: Sign a CONTRACT for a BASIC_OUTCOME of essential Goods and Services.  This implicitly trades your future Work for the future Work of others.

WORK-TO-OWN: Fulfill a CONTRACT to receive DEEDS of Land ownership "similar to" the Land used to fulfill the BASIC_OUTCOME you already received.

OWN-FOR-GOOD: Hold Land DEEDS to own the future Goods provided by that Land.
