When I was young, I wondered how ants were able to organize their society so each had plenty of food and shelter while fly-covered children holding empty steel bowls kept interrupting my Satuday-morning cartoons.

The TV asked for money to help, but surely the ants didn't have money, so what was their secret?

                                ...

Later I began reading and pondering the strange GNU GPL copyright license.
It requires every user gain access to the Sources of the products they use.
But most users don't care about the sources, so why would they need access?

I thought about this for years.
What if you gained property ownership in a fruit tree when you ate fruit?

I finally realized this arrangement eliminates the usual need to buy those goods.
The owner of a fruit tree does not fruit, he owns it even before it is created!
Even if another person does the work, there is no sale, and so no profit.
This also reduces barrier-to-entry and promotes long term solutions.

                                ...

Hmm, but what about the poor workers?
I eventually saw every worker is also a consumer.

They can gain property ownership in the sources by trading services early.
This reduces the perceived need for jobs and promotes long term solutions.
