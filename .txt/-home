I wondered how the ants organized society.  Each colony was so productive and peaceful.  How did they plan their lives and homes?  Did they have religion and government?

Meanwhile I saw most people work so hard for so little while others gained too much with almost no effort.

Later I read about Richard Stallman's tricky Copyright license requiring every user gain access to the Sources of the Objects they use.

It seemed like such an odd requirement.  Few users would ever choose to 'operate' that intellectual property directly, so what was the point?

The special arrangement minimizes worker barrier-to-entry to bypass excessive rents.

As I continued to search for a better way to organize I found Henry George addressing a similar problem with physical Sources such as land, water, radio spectrum, minerals, etc.

This site is dedicated to combining the intent of these movements to help us regain localized control.
