On the farm I watched the ants, wondering how they organized society.  They were so busy and productive.  How did they plan their lives and homes?  Did they have religion and government?

Later, in the city, I saw people pushing carts with no place to sleep while others had more than they could ever use.  There was plenty of concern and ringing bells, but no lasting solutions.

After the hay was baled and the cattle were fed I would program on the Commodore 64 in BASIC and then in 6510 assembly.  Construction work sent me around the US and finally to Murmansk, Russia.  I returned to school for a Bachelor's in Computer Science and begin working as a Software Engineer.

Meanwhile I noticed Richard Stallman using Copyright in a tricky way to insure every user has at-cost access to the Sources of the products they use.  It seemed like such an odd requirement since so few users knew what Sources were, and would rarely try to 'operate' that intellectual property directly, so what was the point?  But now I see this special arrangement minimizes a worker's barrier-to-entry to bypass those who would impose excessive rents.

Looking for a parallel in the material world, I finally found Henry George concerned with similar problems for finite physical Sources such as land and water.  After years of struggle I realized we can own property For Product to regain localized control.
