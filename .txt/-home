As a child, I wondered how ants organized society.

Every ant in each colony had enough food and shelter
while so many humans went without these basic needs.

How were the ants able to do what we could not?

As I grew older, I worried about this problem more.
I saw many farmers lose their property to debt.

...

Later I noticed the GNU GPL enforces a very strange trade agreement.
It requires every user gain access to the Sources of that Product.
Sources are essentially the Means of Production in the virtual realm.
But few users will ever try to operate the Sources, so what is the point?

I finally realized this reduces barriers-to-entry to nearly zero.

Product-Futures-Foundation.github.io is an attempt to map this into the material realm.
