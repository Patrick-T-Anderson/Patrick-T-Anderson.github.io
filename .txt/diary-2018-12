I was looking at Quora.com/How-can-I-remember-to-breathe-deeply-all-the-time where
Sasmita Singh writes "'Okay, now you do this one because you couldn't remember to breathe deeply all the time. Take a deep breathe and get relaxed. Once in a day is enough but do properly. Do a promise to yourself that " Each day I will do this". If you aren't able to remember then set reminder in your phone and do accordingly. Always  remember just "DEEP BREATHE AND GET RELAXED". If this is your initial stage then no problem, it happens. But when do it regularly you will be able to do it. And if  you  try it regularly YOU CAN, because you have desire and finally you will say, yes "I COULD AND WILL BE CONTINUING".'"
