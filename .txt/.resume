Years of experience:
C and C++: 15+  Build tools and backend services on Windows, Linux and macOS.  Debug, rework and minimize old code.

Linux/UNIX Admin: 15+  I have been using Linux (and some BSDs) on most of my own computers since middle 90s and also know some of the quirkyness of the macOS UNIX environment.

CI/CD: 5+  Automated the build/deploy/test cycle at StorageCraft using Windows Batch files to address product quality issues.  Similarly at Rackware with BASH and Jenkins to deploy and test on various cloud providers (spinup/teardown).  Also used BASH at SlingTV with Jenkins and a little Python and Javascript to automate builds/deploy/test for several device types.

VM/Cloud: 5+  Used KVM, VMware and VirtualBox at StorageCraft while writing tools to convert between virtual disk types.  Used AWS, IBM Cloud, vSphere, KVM, XEN, VirtualBox at Rackware for testing and data migration.

Shell and CMD: 15+  I have been using BASH off and on since 1996. I developed GNUnix 'pkg' to hide differences between package managers. I repaired and extended Batch (Windows .cmd) at StorageCraft and Rackware. I repaired and extended BASH at Rackware and SlingTV and Google.

Teacher/Mentor/Lead: 10+  At BYU I was a teacher's aid and then an independent for C and C++.  I often assum a lead or mentoring role to help younger programmers.

I created Social-Sufficiency-Coalition.github.io CrossCrowdPredictiveProduction.github.io Product-Futures-Foundation.github.io attempting to formalize the definition of the "For Product" economic system.

Storage/Filesystems: 5+  Altiris, StorageCraft, Rackware: Develop cross-platform tools to manage disks and filesystems and convert between different formats.

Distributed Storage: 2+  Deploy cluster filesystem such as CEPH, GlusterFS, Lustre. Co-Design innovative, nearly 'motionless' distributed FS which rarely needs re-balancing and is uses implicit-addressing, meaning the HASH value *is* the location.
