C/C++ Coding: 15+ years.  Most of my career has been focused on these two languages.

As A Lead (if any): 2-7 years.  I have mentored junior programmers and and acted as lead in many of my roles without that title.  I started two companies (Product Futures Foundation and Social Sufficiency Coalition).  While at BYU I was a Teacher's Aid and also taught C++ as an independent tutor.

CentOS 5/7: 5-10 years.  I have been running Linux and NetBSD on most of my personal PCs since the 90's.  I used and supported CentOS extensively at Rackware
I created and maintain a GNU/Linux distro called GNUnix.
I am currently run Fedora 29 on my primary development laptop.

SOAP: 0, but worked extensively with Google Protocol Buffers over REST at Rackware.

CI/CD: 3-5 years.  I took it upon myself to automate the build/deploy/test cycle at StorageCraft using Windows .cmd files - to address some of the quality issues they faced.  At Rackware I did similarly with BASH and Jenkins to deploy and test on various cloud providers.  At SlingTV I used BASH and Jenkins and some Python to automate builds/deploy/test for several device types.

Shell Scripting: 5-10 years. I used BASH extensively at Rackware because they had so much already built in that language.  I also use it for the GNUnix 'pkg' utilities designed to hide differences between package managers.
