Years of experience:
C and C++: 15+  Built tools, services, device drivers (kernel level).  Reworked, simplified, minimized old code.  A little more than half of this was on Windows, the rest on Linux and macOS.

Linux Use: 15+  Used Linux on many of my own computers since middle 90s.  Also used NetBSD booting over bootp for a few years to compare.  Used CentOS extensively at Rackware and currently run Fedora on my development laptop.

Linux Admin: 5+  Been administering Linux (install/maintain) on my own computers since 90s.  Created and maintain a GNU/Linux distro (overlay of scripts) called GNUnix.

CI/CD: 5+  Initiated automation of build/deploy/test cycle at StorageCraft using Windows Batch files to address product quality issues. Similarly at Rackware with BASH and Jenkins to deploy and test on various cloud providers (spinup/teardown).  At SlingTV I used BASH and Jenkins and a little Python to automate builds/deploy/test for several device types.

VM/Cloud: 5+  Used KVM, VMware and VirtualBox at StorageCraft while writing tools to convert between virtual disk types.  Used AWS, IBM Cloud, vSphere, KVM, XEN, VirtualBox at Rackware for testing and data migration.

Shell: 5+  Used BASH extensively at Rackware because they had so much already built in that language.  Also use it for the GNUnix 'pkg' utils designed to hide differences between package managers.

Lead: 5+  While never given a supervisor title, I have mentored junior programmers and acted as lead in many of my roles.  Started two organizations to explore new economic concepts (Product Futures Foundation and Social Sufficiency Coalition).  At BYU I was a Teacher's Aid for two classes and also taught C++ as an independent tutor.

Filesystems: 5+  Altiris, StorageCraft, Rackware: Develop cross-platform tools to manage disks and filesystems and convert between different formats.

Cluster Filesystems: 2+  Deploy cluster filesystem such as CEPH, GlusterFS, Lustre. Co-Design innovative, nearly 'motionless' cluster filesystem based on implicit addressing.
