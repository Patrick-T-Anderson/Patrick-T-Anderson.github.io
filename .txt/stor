A pure P2P chat system can be tricky.

For example, imagine node 'A' chats to 'B', but 'B' is offline, then 'A' goes offline before 'B' is back online...

One solution is to store data on node 'C' "in return for" 'C' being allowed to store data on node 'A' and 'B'.

This reciprocal compensation model allows us to "pay" each other at any quality-of-service level without passing tokens (without using any form of 'money').


Video needs more storage and faster networks, so a pure P2P system may struggle to deliver when all Nodes are small.

To overcome this, each Node could initially contact a central Registry server (DNS name or IP address could be "hard coded" into each client) to report their availability, and to find other Nodes.

which use a location-based naming convention to quickly discover other Nodes near them.

and also to be a Registry for naming and Node discovery.

to host Video and other big files

To promote MetaNodes, each Node offers reciprocation in the form of:
. Storage
. Original content (new Video, for example)
. Skills (by signing Work_Contracts)
