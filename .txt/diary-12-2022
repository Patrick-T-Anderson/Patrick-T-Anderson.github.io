2022-12-11: How to Invest in the Earth Change Operating System:

ECOS uses 1 FT (Fungible Token) to fund the purchase of Land and Water rights and seeds and spores and tools and startup supplies to build productively-sovereign ecovillages owned and operated by those occupants.

ECOS uses 3 SFTs (Semi-Fungible Tokens) to organize the predictable Future Production required to produce a Basic Outcome onsite, eventually without any Imports.

We Offer:
. earthⒸhange: A Coin limited in circulation by Square_Meters of Land held under these Terms.
. Source_Titles📑: Ownership of Land, Water and other finite INPUTS of Future Production.
. Work_Contracts✍: Agreements to supply human the INPUTS of Future Production.
. Product_Tickets🎟: Agreements to deliver a finished OUTPUT of Future Production.

Rules:
. You MAY buy the earthⒸhange Coin (Ⓒ) with Money💳.
. You MAY buy Product_Tickets🎟 with Work_Contracts✍.
. You MAY buy Product_Tickets🎟 with Money💳, if offered.
. You MUST gain Source_Titles📑 as you complete Work_Contracts✍.
. You CANNOT buy Source_Titles📑 with Money💳.
. You CANNOT buy earthⒸhange with Work_Contracts✍.

The relationship between the Work_Contracts✍ and Product_Tickets🎟
differs for each Group_of_Groups, but can be found by estimating
the time required from each occupant to achieve a Basic Outcome
for that Group_of_Groups, at that location, at that time.

Before the work_auction_sequence begins,
all jobs require the same amount of time.

During the work_auction_sequence,
Work_Contracts✍ which do not receive bids
are adjusted to decrease the amount of time required
to fulfill that portion of the Basic Outcome.

For simplicity, imagine a single-product economy (such as Breadlandia) with just a handful of jobs, such as: farmer, builder, cook(er), cleaner, doctor.

Fun and easy jobs may auction quickly, while unfun (cleaner) or hard (doctor) will likely auction more slowly, so will need to be adjusted to find applicants.

The `work_auction_sequence` DECREASES the number of hours required to fulfill unpopular and/or high-skill and/or high-risk Work_Contracts.

This necessarily INCREASES the amount of time required of the other occupants to achieve the Basic Outcome they agreed upon (and so may cause a cascading adjustment).

Today I drove to the physical location of WoodStreetCommons.com

A desolate and slightly sad but also inspiring oasis of potential.

The Party had been canceled.

I wanted to document, but also felt reverence.

A man struggled to put a bag in a box.
