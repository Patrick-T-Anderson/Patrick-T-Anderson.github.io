land + work * (tools + 1) = product

Wages chase rent, keeping workers in debt.
But rent is zero when occupants own.

So let us buy land to make villages,
where occupants own local supply chains
to produce all essential food and medicine

and trade skills 

and trade work agreements
in a For Product manner,

to own future
goods and services
even before production,

and so solve the conflict
betwixt eaters and owners.
