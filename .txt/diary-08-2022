The 4 Tokens:
Each **earthChange** is a Fungible Token (FT) representing one of the square-meters of Land being targeted for acquisition.  For each real-estate listing, the DAO auctions those coins to buy that Land and startup supplies and many other costs of bootstrapping a Minimum Viable Village.  This coin conveys no rights of governance, has no redeemable value, and does not represent property ownership.

Each **Product_Ticket** is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) limited in circulation by the number of all goods and services needed by all of the occupants within that Minimum Viable Village.

Each **Product_Ticket** represents an *individual serving* of a specific and (semi)-unique good or service
is instead exchanged for **Work_Contract** signatures.
3. **Work_Contract** NFT represent *future* work.
4. **Source_Title** NFT represents property ownership in finite Sources such as Land, Water Rights, Mineral Rights, etc.  **Source_Titles** cannot be purchased with traditional Money, nor with **earthChange**, but can only be obtained by completing **Work_Contracts**.

The Costs of Production include
1. Destructibles: Things that are "used up", such as Work, a Sandwich, any instance of SPACE in TIME, such as "one night stay in a private room".  Physical objects usually cannot occupy the same SPACE at the same TIME.  With TIME as another dimension, we are in 4D.

2. Semi-Destructibles: Things that can be repaired, but have a limited lifetime, such as an instance of SPACE like a private room.  This 3.5D version slightly ignores TIME
.
2. Indestructibles: Things that can be "reused", such as Land, Water,

Land vs Coin - Usury and our Accidental Quest for Failure

AP: "I have it!" exclaimed the Apprentice.
AP: "We can Own Land in Groups to Produce all we Need, Locally!"

The Old Man rolled his eyes...

AP: "And Sign Work_Contracts to Ensure that Production."


The Old Man thought for a moment, and then began to laugh,
OM: "That's no way to make a Profit!"

OM: "If people could Share Sources and Trade Work, they might create Minimum_Viable_Villages to produce all essentials onsite without paying Financial Returns!"

The Apprentice paused and began wonder "What is Profit?" and "What is Money?" and "What is Real Value?"...

The Old Man interrupted  "The GDP would tumble if people could Own for Good and Specialize without Money!"

The Apprentice sighed as saw the conflict between Financial Returns and Real Value.

....

Coins flow to rich from poor when Users do not own.

But when you own your Home, Rent is ZERO!
And when you own Trees, you own that Fruit even before it is a Flower.

So we can own Homes to avoid paying Rent, and own Supply_Chains to avoid paying Profit.

We should some things own in Groups for efficiency,
and form Groups_of_Groups to trade work more easily.

For safety and sovereignty, each Group_of_Groups should be a Minimum_Viable_Village producing all essential goods and servives onsite.

In this way we can build semi-autonomous private cities controlled by those occupant-owners where Rent and Profit appear on the "Growth Edge", such as when you didn't predict everything you wanted, or when selling surplus to 'tourists', and also for new inventions, and even just when changing your mind about what you want.

Page1/Cover: [Pictures of Blueberries, Bread, Water, Apples]
Response: Visually it is beautiful, but could use more contrast between *Sources* compared to *Products*.
For example, Land, Water and Blueberry Bushes, Wheat fields and Apple orchards are *Sources*, while Blueberries, Bread and Apples are *Products*.

Page2/Overview:
Though it is true, the first sentence is rough

Here are some suggested rewordings:
"The FOR PRODUCT MODEL utilizes our natural quest for profit to empower joint ownership of essential supply chains to more equitably disburse the goods and services we need."

"You may purchase the EARTHCHANGE coin to support new sustainable systems and those that are trying to re-imagine our planet.  You may also profit if the monetary value of the coin increases!"

"The EARTHCHANGE coin is sold to purchase the land and tools and startup supplies required to build Minimum Viable Villages, each using the FOR PRODUCT MODEL and usually managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)."

"Any group who accepts the terms of the FOR PRODUCT MODEL may be funded in this way."

"We can value people and planet first while using profit to support the entire ecosystem."

"from the sell of the coin"
OR----
"from selling the coin"

"to purchase physical land"
OR----
"to purchase land and tools"

"To claim future goods or services with a PRODUCT TICKET, a WORK CONTRACT is signed by a VILLAGER"
OR----
"To claim future goods and services with PRODUCT TICKETS, each VILLAGER signs a WORK CONTRACT."
OR----
"Each VILLAGER signs a WORK CONTRACT for PRODUCT TICKETS representing future goods and services.

"The VILLAGER / WORKER uses source materials and machinery to help create the FINAL PRODUCT"
OR----
"Each VILLAGER uses land and tools to create one of the FINAL PRODUCTS being offered at that VILLAGE."
OR----
"Each VILLAGER uses land and tools to help fulfill one of the PRODUCT TICKETS being offered at that VILLAGE."

"Having completed their WORK CONTRACT, the VILLAGER submits the PRODUCT TICKET and receives the FINAL PRODUCT"
BUT----
There is alot to unpack here that may or may not be obvious.
Each PRODUCT TICKET supply chain may require many WORK CONTRACTS to produce a FINAL PRODUCT.
For example, Farming, Milling and Baking are some of the jobs required to make Bread.
On the first day of occupation, the VILLAGE will not yet be self sufficient because production has not even begun, so part of the startup costs must also include the supplies and tools required to Clean, Feed and House every VILLAGER while they build more permanent solutions.
Because of this, some WORK CONTRACTS are more crucial during 'startup', while other may not yet make sense.
While VILLAGES will likely buy "off the shelf" tools to Farm, Mill and Bake, as Villages group together, they can achieve longer term goals such as building those tools, and eventually even making the tools to make the tools, to thereby *recursively* own and control those supply chains.
