"'In game theory, a repeated game is an extensive form game that consists of a number of repetitions of some base game (called a stage game). The stage game is usually one of the well-studied 2-person games. Repeated games capture the idea that a player will have to take into account the impact of his or her current action on the future actions of other players; this impact is sometimes called his or her reputation. Single stage game or single shot game are names for non-repeated games.'"

JoinFairGround.com >>Citizen Owned Private Cities

From the "Fairground Whitepaper v3.0" at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_636cLWhI-LZw_KYkIm6hjNDM8dZSsMn/
"'
Abstract: Property is the foundation of a free and functioning market.
Land is the literal foundation of our existence. With this in mind,
defining the rightful private use of land in the market becomes a
question of defining our right to exist. If we’ve determined that every
human has an equal right to exist then our property model for land
should reflect that. We propose a competitive common ownership
system autonomously administered using blockchain technology.
Through an annual ownership bidding process the flow value of land
utility could be quantified in a market assessed ground rent,
economically incentivizing efficient land use while also providing a
community member dividend.

Introduction
Community organizations owning physical property will often rely on a voting process to
determine how the property can be used and by whom. The problem with this approach
is a misalignment of incentives and a lack of personal accountability. There’s no real
costs or risks involved in casting a vote. An elected board or voting majority can easily
externalize most, if not all the costs and risks of their decisions on the remainder of the
community. If the majority votes to cancel rent for example, it's the minority group of
real estate investors that will bear the cost. Voting with one's own wallet on the other
hand is perfectly suited to economic choices by placing all decision making power in the
hands of those with skin in the game and the best track record of efficient capital
allocation.

1

We propose an open land protocol that applies a perpetual ground rent for the private
use of community resources through a competitive ownership bidding process. Below
we’ll outline the market mechanisms that could be used in such a system to
continuously and efficiently manage and expand the stock of community resources
autonomously and free from private or political capture.

Acquisition
Land is acquired using a real estate crowdfunding platform. Anyone can use the
platform and launch a campaign to raise funds to purchase property. If successfully
funded, the real estate is purchased and the public land title is transferred to the
community's legal entity. Property ownership defaults to the campaign creator and their
investors in the form of an owner NFT (non-fungible token).

Ownership
Very little about real estate ownership needs to change under a competitive common
ownership model. The owner would have full private control of the property and pay an
annual assessment similar to a property tax. Only the method of assessment would
change. Rather than a government assessment, the market would assess the value by
taking offers every 12 months. The new assessed value is the highest bid.
The owner is free to accept or reject the offers. If no action is taken, the highest bid is
accepted with the annual ground rent being paid as part of the transaction similar to a
sellers fee. Otherwise the current owner can reject the offers by paying the newly
assessed annual ground rent which is a fixed percentage of the highest bid. The
process repeats each year and the annual ground rent may rise or fall based on the
market while the owner is also free to sell at any time in between.

Improvement
Owners have all the standard incentives to improve their properties. Of course, it can be
expected that annual ground rent will put downward pressure on sale prices similar to
high property tax areas.

2

While there are no exemptions from the ground rent there’s an important caveat. The
ground rent exists to provide a community dividend. If the owner is a member of the
community their dividend will be offsetting. This means that ground rent only begins to
take effect when an owner finds themselves in the upper 50th percentile of property
users. Or in other words, it kicks in when the total value of the property under their
personal control exceeds that of the average member. Conversely, anyone controlling
less real estate value than average would see their ground rent completely covered or
exceeded by their annual dividend.

Use
Typically, property zoning and density fall under the jurisdiction of the local government.
The sovereignty of the property owner runs up against the will of the people in
government form, or at least that’s the rationale. As discussed earlier, the result is
unaccountable voting power being substituted for rational economic calculation.
A much better approach would be a level playing field where both sides have equal skin
in the game. The property owner could retain sovereignty to the extent that they are
willing to pay the annually assessed ground rent. Any opposing parties would have an
equal opportunity to do the same by offering a bid. They will either succeed in taking
ownership of the property or raise the current occupants' ground rent as compensation
for the undesired use.

With neither side able to strong arm the other, communities can physically self organize.
Infrastructure and public space could all be competitively provided by private builders.
Cities can be designed bottom-up by the market without need for a central planner
regulating what gets built and where.

3

While the system imposes no top down regulation it’s important to note that members
are still subject to the overriding laws of the local jurisdiction which may include building
and zoning regulation. The community is free to organize and push back against any
restrictions not providing value or buy land in less restrictive areas.

Membership
Membership can and should be open and free to everyone. The sole requirement would
be an identity verification process to ensure one dividend per member. Each member is
entitled to one equal share of all real estate ground rent as a member dividend.
Initially, the member dividend maximum will need to be artificially pegged to the US
average home value index. This will simulate an asset-to-member ratio on par with the
broader US real estate market and allow members to invest in real estate without a
concern that a membership increase will reduce their dividend offset. Eventually the
ratio of real estate asset value per member will either match or exceed the artificial peg
and the dividend will become fully equalized amongst members. Until that point the peg
provides market parity for real estate acquisition and development. Members would be
able to market their ground rent offsets to investors up to their individual dividend
maximum.

Incentive
By simply applying an annual market assessed ground rent to land use we are able to
disengage private and state monopoly control and bring land ownership fully into the
competitive landscape. The consumer preference for a certain parcel of land is then
quantifiable in the broader market context and can be measured against alternative
uses.

Competition can drive all resources to their highest and best use while compensating
the community for their monopolization. Real estate uses with broader member
participation will be economically favored due to the groups larger aggregate dividend
offset. For example, it would be much more expensive for a private park owner to keep
the entire property to themselves than to open it up for everyone.

4

Upgrade
For purposes of system upgrades, changes, or its full elimination, 100% investor
consensus would be required. Fortunately, no voting process would be needed.
Because the ground rent system imposes a cost and fixes the holdout problem, a
sufficient group of owners would be able to apply enough buyout pressure to achieve
consensus. In the meantime, they would receive compensatory ground rent from the
holdouts until they decide to sell or agree to the new terms.
Conclusion
Nations rise and fall based on their ability to manage scarce resources. The most
important metric for any economizing organization should be its resource efficiency, or
in other words, its bottomline. The simple mechanism of a market driven ground rent
can establish this common language for real estate efficiency while also providing
community benefit.
A community system that establishes our shared right to the inherent value of nature
without inhibiting our private right to enjoy and improve it could completely change the
standing of the individual in our economy and correct some of our longest standing
societal ills in the process.'"

2022-09-18: A Tokenless Storage Strategy

Two big use-cases for storage are Chat and Video.

Chat requires very little storage, but imagine node 'A' chats to 'B', but 'B' is offline, then 'A' goes offline before 'B' is back online...

One solution is to store data on node 'C' "in return for" 'C' being allowed to store data on node 'A' and 'B'.

This reciprocal compensation model allows us to "pay" each other at any quality-of-service level without using any kind of money.

Video needs big storage and fast network, so a pure P2P system may struggle to deliver when all Nodes are small (such as cheaper cell-phones)

To overcome this Nodes should find other Nodes and recursively group into MetaNodes.

and also to be a Registry for naming and Node discovery.

to host Video and other big files

To promote MetaNodes (Node Clustering at any level), each Node offers reciprocation in the form of:
. Storage
. Original content (new Video, for example)
. Skills (by signing Work_Contracts)

ECORISE.finance/ECORISE%20WHITEPAPER.pdf

Here are som ideas for when we are building villages.

>>- $ECO is used to purchase property.
We can sell the $EARTHCHANGE Fungible Token (coin) to buy the parcels used for village property.
$EARTHCHANGE does not represent land ownership, has no utility and conveys no governance.

>>- Land Title is turned into NFT and locked.
In villages, Land Titles will vest to village occupants as they complete Work_Contracts.


>>... continuous revenue for ECORISE, and DAO partners.
We will structure essential production such as food, shelter, basic healthcare, sanitation, transportation, etc.

Occupants select Product_Tickets to 'vote' on village production, and then 'pay' for that production by signing Work_Contracts.

Each village occupant gains unshared, private, excludable ownership for their personal space and never pay Rent as they each are on a work-to-own program.

Occupants also gain co-ownership in the group production used to achieve essential production of predictable goods and services, and so do not pay Profit.

Because of this, the core of the village will generate almost no revenue, but will likely generate financial returns by selling surplus to "tourists".

Some of that Profit may be used to pay ECORISE, and DAO partners.

Some of that Profit must be invested for the User (tourist) who bought the surplus Product.
    The DAO then buys even more Land and slowly vests those Titles to those Users (tourists).
        This causes each User to gain the Property required to make the Products they use.

This causes all Users to slowly become Owners, which further stablizes the User_Owned 'core'.
As the core increases in size, there is even more surplus to sell, so even more Profit to be distributed.

In the theoretical end, once people on Earth live in this way, Profit and Rent will only come from missed predictions and new inventions, and even then it is only temporary since those Users will also gain Land Titles (and water rights and mineral rights and other finite things) required for that production.

"'Technitium Mesh is a secure, anonymous, peer-to-peer (p2p), open source instant messenger designed to provide end-to-end encryption. Primary aim of developing this instant messenger is to provide privacy which is achieved using cryptography and anonymity using Tor network. It can be used over Internet and private LAN networks (without Internet) for instant messaging and file transfer with support for private chats and group chats.

Mesh is based on Bit Chat and is its successor. Mesh takes core ideas from its predecessor and removes a few. Notably, Mesh does not require centralized user registration and provides anonymous profile support using Tor hidden service. It also removes use of BitTorrent trackers for finding peers which was causing issues with Bit Chat since some ISPs blocking BitTorrent traffic would also block Bit Chat traffic. Instead, Mesh relies only on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) for all purposes.

Mesh allows creating both pure p2p and anonymous profiles with support for running multiple profiles concurrently. Both p2p and anonymous profiles are interoperable such that a p2p profile user can connect with an anonymous profile user via Tor Network.

With Mesh, there is no meta data generated. User identifier is designed in such a way that it can be changed anytime to hide identity. Since, there is no user registration, we don't know who uses Mesh or how many people use it. In p2p mode, the connections use IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity directly to connect with peers without any server in between. With anonymous mode, all connectivity occurs over Tor network and uses Tor hidden service to accept inbound connections.'"

"'
Cryptocurrency exchanges are vital for the circulation and trading of cryptocurrencies and without the availability of a particular currency on an exchange, users could not be able to obtain it or liquidate their holdings of the currency when they require. For a cryptocurrency, not being listed on a cryptocurrency exchange is a major hindrance as then it no longer remains a potential purchase option for anyone who was not able to obtain it during the ICO. Users may even not take apart for a token in an ICO if it is not listed on an exchange as they desire the ability to change their cryptocurrency to any other asset, based on market conditions. It is also essential for them to be able to change their cryptocurrency into fiat currencies as not all transactions are possible through cryptocurrencies.

In a nutshell, listing on a cryptocurrency exchange is crucial to the acceptability of a cryptocurrency and its functioning.

How can I get listed on a cryptocurrency exchange?

Considering the importance of listing for any cryptocurrency, it is crucial for cryptocurrencies to know the path for listing on a cryptocurrency exchange. This process involves the following key steps:

The first step is communication with a preferred cryptocurrency exchange about a potential for listing on the exchange. It is essential that a thorough evaluation is made on the background of the exchange and its functioning. The key parameters which are often discussed are:

a) Whether the exchange operates in the countries where you want the circulation of your cryptocurrency?
b) Does the exchange allow conversion from fiat currency to cryptocurrency or only between cryptocurrencies?
c) Whether the exchange is centralized or decentralized?
d) The listing fees charged by the exchange
e) The technical details of the token and the platform

Considering the complexity of the issues to be considered in the listing process, it is highly recommended that token issuers should approach a professional who has experience in the token listing process. The professional can assist in narrowing down on potential exchanges for listing and simplify the application process for listing.

In the next step, the exchange through the professional communicates a list of documents that would be required for the listing process. Normally, the professional arranges documents such as legal memorandum on behalf of the token issuer. Empire Global has an in-house team of legal experts who have expertise in the legal evaluation of the compatibility of a Token with the existing legal framework.

The third step involves the filling up and filing of the application form along with the required documentation and fee. After the filing process is complete, the professional will generally followup on your behalf to understand the progress of the application process.

If the application is accepted, the final stage involves the technological integration of the token with the exchange and arrangement of the payment process for issuance of new tokens and any transfer of an additional fee for listing.

What are the documentation requirements for listing on an exchange?

The documentation requirements for listing on a cryptocurrency exchange can vary depending on the exchange and the token which is sought to be listed. The exact requirements will normally be communicated by the professional that you have engaged to assist in the listing process.

The following documents are required in the listing process:

a) Information about the Token issuer and the entire team involved
b) The problem that the token seeks to resolve
c) The technological background and the platform where it is used
d) The utility of the Token
e) Current status of the platform and the token
f) Legal memorandum from a qualified legal professional about the compatibility of the token with the existing legal framework (it is arranged by Empire Global)
g) The Whitepaper and the ICO process
h) Information about any regulatory action
