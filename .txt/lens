LENS - Law Enabling Natural Systems

Introduction
The LENS language uses Human-Readable + Legally-Binding + Machine-Readable TOKENS to structure real-world production.

## Value Types:
SOURCES: Land, water, and many other INPUTS required for PRODUCTION.
SKILLS: All of the thought and human INPUTS required for PRODUCTION.
PRODUCT: A specific, unique, usually decaying, OUTPUT of PRODUCTION.

## 
For each Value Type, mint one Token:

SOURCE_TITLEüóÇ: A legally-binding agreement declaring 'personal' or 'shared' or 'system' Property Ownership in SOURCES.

SKILL_CONTRACT: A legally-binding agreement to achieve *one step* in the supply chain of a specific PRODUCT_TICKETüé´, usually on a schedule.

PRODUCT_TICKETüé´: A legally-binding agreement to achieve *all steps* in *all* the supply-chains required to deliver future PRODUCTION at a projected quantity and quality, usually on a schedule.

Optional: EARTHCHANGE: A Fungible Token (FT), or 'Coin' with a circulating supply limited by the number of M¬≤ of Land being held as SOURCE_TITLESüóÇ.


== Value Loop:
BOOT: For each M¬≤ of each Parcel, Mint 1 EARTHCHANGE Coin, then sell those Coins to buy that Land and all the startup supplies needed to create yet another Minimum Viable Village.

BOOT: If coin_auction_sequence succeeds, buy Sources and begin work_auction_sequence.

START: 

Each Occupant must sign a Skill_Contract to deliver some part in one of the supply chains required for a Basic Outcome.

RUN: Each occupant is guaranteed* a Basic Outcome of essential production (as defined by you and others within the Group of Groups attempting to establish this Minimum Viable Village).
RUN: As you complete SKILL_CONTRACTS, you gain SOURCE_TITLE ownership*.
RUN: SOURCE_TITLES are held to avoid paying PROFIT to others.

FORK: Owners must reflect some profit as the payer's investment.
FORK: Subgroups must be allowed to split from groups.
FORK: Subgroups must be allowed to localize control.

Pseudocode
Layout GRID where each CELL represents 1 square meter of LAND.
For each CELL on the GRID, apply .lens file:
    BOOT:
      If using Debt or Equity, show PROFIT flowing back to Banks and Sharks.
    SKILL:
      If receiving WAGES, show VALUE flowing back to OWNERS as RENT or PROFIT.
    VEST:
      If vesting for PROFIT, show the rich getting richer.
    HOLD:
      If holding for PROFIT, show some abundance may conflict with OWNER goals.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO
The DAO issues one FT (earth‚í∏hange) for each M¬≤ of land.
The DAO asks for `minimum_bid` as list-price / M¬≤ + estimated costs.

The DAO auctions those earth‚í∏hange to buy that parcel.

If the coin auction succeeds, and the parcel is slated for occupation, the DAO asks for the specific Product_Ticketsüé´ that Group of Groups chooses to produce.

Product_Ticketsüé´ often require many Work_Contracts‚úç and many Source_TitlesüóÇ to secure that production.

Sign a Work_Contract‚úç to receive a Basic Outcome of Product_Ticketsüé´.

As you complete Work_Contracts‚úç, Source_TitlesüóÇ vest to you as your real property ownership, under the terms of the For_Product model as defined below.

There are 3 types of Source_TitlesüóÇ, in order of importance: PERSON, SYSTEM, SHARED.
1. PERSON: wash, eat, rest, play - meta-structure of a single-cell organism
2. SYSTEM: roads, pipes, external border - multi-cellular meta-structure
3. SHARED: specialized factories enable higher complexity

Each occupant MUST gain Source_TitlesüóÇ of all 3 types.

The specific Source_TitlesüóÇ you gain are based the Product_Ticketsüé´ you selected.

Kernel Template
Select one of each OPTION to create a new kernel:
BOOT: Sell OPTION{Debt, Equity, NFT, Coin} to buy SOURCES.
SKILL: Receives OPTION{WAGES, PRODUCTION, SOURCES}.
VEST: Pay or risk OPTION{MONEY, SKILL} to gain SOURCE_TITLES in the OPTION{SKILL you provide, PRODUCTION you USE}.
HOLD: SOURCE_TITLES are held to OPTION{collect PROFIT, collect PRODUCT, avoid paying PROFIT}.
