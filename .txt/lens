LENS - Law Enabling Natural Systems

Introduction
The LENS language uses Human-Readable + Legally-Binding + Machine-Readable TOKENS to structure real-world production.

The LENS interpreter reads these files to modify and constrain the DAO UI (such as ChangeMaker, Metaopoly, MetaMaker, MoneyMaker).

------------------------------------------------Example .lens file:
INFO: #!lens
INFO: Rewriting the For_Product model in LENS...
INFO:

GOAL: Local PRODUCTION of essential GOODS and SERVICES
PRODUCTION: Apply SKILLS to SOURCES to create and maintain PRODUCTION
SOURCES: land, water rights, mineral rights, and other finite things; organisims, tools and other semi-finite things; art, design, ideas, software and other infinite things
SKILL: Potential Human effort applied to SOURCES to achieve one step in PRODUCTION
SKILL_GUILD: A group sharing risk and reward across SKILL_CONTRACTS

COSTS: WAGES + "opportunity loss" + pollution + other externalities
PRICE: MONEY paid by USERS to OWNERS
PROFIT: USER_PRICE - OWNER_COSTS

USE: Exclusive access to a SOURCE or PRODUCT
HOLD: SOURCE_TITLES are held to avoid paying Profit, Rent or Interest

EARTHCHANGE: A Fungible Token (FT), or 'Coin' with a circulating supply limited by the number of square meters of Land being held as SOURCE_TITLES.

SKILL_CONTRACT: A legally-binding agreement to achieve *one step* in the supply chain of a specific PRODUCT_TICKET  , usually on a schedule.
Each SKILL_CONTRACT is Non-Fungible-Token (NFT), but may be treated as a Semi-Fungible-Token (SFT) when held by a SKILL_GUILD.

PRODUCT_TICKET: A legally-binding agreement to achieve *all steps* in *all* the supply-chains required to deliver future production at a projected quantity and quality, usually on a schedule.
Each PRODUCT TICKET is a Non-Fungible-Token (NFT), but may be treated as a Semi-Fungible-Token (SFT) when the associated SOURCE_TITLES are being held as SHARED_TITLE.

SOURCE_TITLE: A legally-binding agreement of Property Ownership in SOURCES.
Each SOURCE TITLE is Non-Fungible-Token (NFT), but may be treated as a Semi-Fungible-Tokens (SFT) when held as SHARED_TITLE.
SHARED_TITLE: A group sharing risk and reward across SOURCE_TITLES.


BOOT: For each Square Meter of each Parcel of real-estate currently for sale, Mint 1 EARTHCHANGE Coin, then sell those Coins to buy that Land and all the startup supplies needed to create yet another Minimum Viable Village.

INFO: Waiting for EARTHCHANGE coin_auction_sequence to complete...
BOOT: For each Parcel, LOOP until the EARTHCHANGE coin_auction_sequence finishes
BOOT: If coin_auction_sequence succeeds, buy Sources and annouce 1st day of work!
INFO: The EARTHCHANGE circulating_supply is strictly limited to the number of square meters of Land being held as SOURCE_TITLES.

START: Each Occupant must sign a Skill_Contract to deliver some part in one of the supply chains required for a Basic Outcome.

RUN: Each occupant is guaranteed* a Basic Outcome of essential production (as defined by you and others within the Group of Groups attempting to establish this Minimum Viable Village).
RUN: As you complete SKILL_CONTRACTS, you gain SOURCE_TITLE ownership*.
RUN: SOURCE_TITLES are held to avoid paying PROFIT to others.

FORK: Owners must reflect some profit as the payer's investment.
FORK: Subgroups must be allowed to split from groups.
FORK: Subgroups must be allowed to localize control.

Pseudocode
Layout GRID where each CELL represents 1 square meter of LAND.
For each CELL on the GRID, apply .lens file:
    BOOT:
      If using Debt or Equity, show PROFIT flowing back to Banks and Sharks.
    SKILL:
      If receiving WAGES, show VALUE flowing back to OWNERS as RENT or PROFIT.
    VEST:
      If vesting for PROFIT, show the rich getting richer.
    HOLD:
      If holding for PROFIT, show some abundance may conflict with OWNER goals.

Kernel Template
Select one of each OPTION to create a new kernel:
BOOT: Sell OPTION{Debt, Equity, NFT, Coin} to buy SOURCES.
SKILL: Receives OPTION{WAGES, PRODUCTION, SOURCES}.
VEST: Pay or risk OPTION{MONEY, SKILL} to gain SOURCE_TITLES in the OPTION{SKILL you provide, PRODUCTION you USE}.
HOLD: SOURCE_TITLES are held to OPTION{collect PROFIT, collect PRODUCT, avoid paying PROFIT}.
