Statement of Intent
Empower groups-of-groups to own and control the production of essential goods and services.

Definitions
Product Tickets represent future goods and services.
Work Agreements represent legally binding commitments to achieve future production.
Source Titles represent property ownership in land, tools, and other productive assets.

Terms of Operation
You may buy Product Tickets with money to receive that future good or service, just like crowdfunding.
You may buy Product Tickets by signing Work Agreements to achieve some future production in the system.
When paying with Work Agreements, you also receive Source Title ownership as that production is completed.
As a Source Title owner, you may decide what must and must not be produced on that land.
As a Source Title owner, you must supply the work required for that production, or sign Work Agreements to fill other requests in the system.  You must have a chain-of-exchange to those other requests.
As a Source Title owner, you are the *automatic* owner of all future production on that land.
These terms must work when co-owing in groups and groups-of-groups, in a fractal way.

Pilot Project Startup Timeline
Find raw land for sale outside of city limits to build a self-hosted micro-city.
Verify which essential goods and services can be produced at this location.
Issue and auction Product Tickets to secure land and tools startup supplies without debt.
Issue and auction Source Titles to secure Work Agreement signatures.
If both auctions succeed, the property is purchased and production begins!

You can stop throwing your money away on rent.  You don't need to spend years saving for a down payment.  No need to stress over your credit.  Fairground offers you a new way to live and build equity in real estate without all the hassles and stress of buying a home.
Think of Fairground as a diversified real estate holding where each owner gets a piece of the total rental income. As an owner, your monthly payment builds equity in your equal share of the diversified monthly real estate income.
Build equity in diversified real estate that pays you a growing dividend for life!'"

Despite living at the most prosperous time in history the rising generation faces growing concerns with unaffordable housing and homelessness, an exploitative gig economy, massive job automation, and wealth concentration. Our economy appears to have no answer to the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution, and without change, will continue its course towards future generations that are worse off than their parents.
The thing is, in a functioning free market, there's actually no reason for any of these problems to exist.  Thereâ€™s a foundational flaw in our economy with a specific remedy identified by prominent economists throughout history including Adam Smith and Milton Friedman. Essentially, land is not being properly economized, but it can be fixed with proper market forces.
Fairground solves this problem with an investable land trust that combines a novel geonomics based economic framework with a venture capital approach to growth.  Put more simply, Fairground is like a city sized hacker house, providing a community of early stage startups with a free place to live and work together in exchange for equity in their companies.  As the startup city grows its real estate and membership, it displaces our broken economy with one that actually works.'" -- Facebook.com/joinfairground
