The GNU GPL requires every User receive the Sources of the Products they use.
The Users of 🍞 (eaters) would own the Farm, Mill and Bakery.
They would each own that same % of that bread even before it was made.
But that production requires many skills 
You sign a Work_Contract✍ to select Product_Tickets🎫 representing the future production you want.
You will own small amounts of each of those supply-chains to own those products without purchase.

This "pre-allocates" the ownership of predictible products to those who know they will want them.

This absolute vertical integration means ownership of the product🍞 never changes, so profit cannot exist because there is no "late sale".

Similarly, when you own your home, rent is zero (actually UNDEFINED) because there is no monthly transaction.

The final transaction is removed

For example, if you buy a Product_Ticket🎫 representing future strawberries, the DAO dedicates more land to that production.

You 'buy' Product_Tickets🎫 by signing a Work_Contract✍ to fullfill one part in the supply-chain of a specific Product_Ticket🎫.

Each Work_Contract✍ is for a specific job at a specific location at a scheduled time, usually on a recurring basis.

Trading "Future Work" for "Future Production" resolves the usual [Coincidence of Wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants) failure of *late* barter.

................
Pieces:
1. A board depicting a parcel of real land currently for sale.
2. A set of Product_Tickets🎫 representing future production on that land.
3. A set of Work_Contracts✍ representing commitments to achieve future production.

to vote on the future state of that land.

Within the game, you may buy Product_Tiles can be purchased by signing Work_Contracts.

Product_Tiles represent stationary or moveable objects such as rocks, plants, animals.

Meeting with Twitter.com/Favian_ETH of CityDAO.io and Twitter.com/VanLifeDAO

Agenda:
Overview of Favian's goals for CityDAO and VanlifeDAO.
Overview of Patrick's goals with the For_Product model.

Compare strategies for:
Funding: How can we buy land and pay for other startup costs?  What about ongoing costs?
Production: What real goods and services should we offer?  Can we produce all essentials onsite?
Membership: What is the meaning of membership?  Can you buy membership with work?
Ownership: Who, ideally, will own each square foot?  Why do we own that property?
Rent: How much is the rent?  Notice rent is 0 when the occupant is the owner.
Access: Who is allowed to access each square foot, and under what conditions?
Governance: How are decisions made for each square foot?
Profit: Can we sell surplus goods and services?
SEC: Can we pass the Howey Test?


"'DAO’s Legal Identity Crisis; Why VanlifeDAO Will be a Marshall Island Nonprofit LLC'" https://mirror.xyz/favian.eth/CzccyQTvAGsNQXG-N0_A86ZtkKjoV5c72zNrgFR0e2k

"'At launch, Vanlife DAO will issue 10,000 non-fungible tokens (“NFT”) that will grant the holders membership in the DAO. The first 144 NFTs will be issued as “founding member” NFTs. The first election will take place after the first 144 founding members join.

Eighty percent (80%) of the proceeds from the sales of the NFT at minting will go directly to the community treasury, which will be managed by the community towards acquiring the land that will be used as the communities’ resorts.'"

Overproduction and The Crisis of Capitalism

    
When we own property for profit,
we must maintain sensible amount of scarcity,
imagine the loss if needs were free!

Profit is a




The amount of Profit in the system is inversely related to the amount of Property held For_Product.
    Profit = 1/Property
    Rent = 1/Land

The [Tendency for the rate of profit to fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall) is a concern for those who own for profit.

The For_Product model defines the ecology and economy required for Minimum Viable Villages producing an Onsite Basic Outcome of all essential goods and services.

The ecology is inspired by GeoffLawton.com, OneCommunityGlobal.org, LowTech.org, ApproPedia.org
The economy is inspired by the GNU GPL Copyright license (sharing Sources), crowdfunding (Product_Tickets🎫 are user-driven production) , Income Sharing Agreements (ISA), Nondominium (Chris Cook), Imputed Rent, Vertical Integration, Token Engineering, Tokenomics, Economic Systems, Operating Systems, kernel development.

Most people spend most money on rent.
But rent is zero when occupier-owned.

You work to own Sources, then hold Sources to own Products. 
 

== Timeline
Find land for sale that can be used to build a permacultured private city.
Verify the essential goods and services we could produce at that location.
Issue Product_Tickets🎫 representing those future goods and services.
Issue Work_Contracts✍ representing commitments to achieve future production.
Issue Source_Titles🗂 representing land ownership and water rights.
Auction Product_Tickets🎫 for Work_Contract✍ signatures.
Auction earthChange▦ coins to buy that land and startup supplies.
If both auctions succeed, buy land and tools and announce first day of work.
Vest Source_Titles🗂 to workers as Work_Contract✍ are fulfilled.

The DAO auctions 1 earthChange coin for each square meter of land under consideration.
The DAO then issues Product_Tickets🎫, each representing the onsite future production of a specific good or service.
The DAO then issues Work_Contracts✍, each representing the future human effort required to fulfill some part in the many supply-chains delivering the many Product_Ticket🎫.

The DAO then begins the `work_auction_sequence` to discover the "Compensation_Ratio" of each job.  Fun and easy jobs may auction quickly at a Compensation_Ratio of 1, while difficult or unfun jobs may take longer as the Compensation_Ratio increases exponentially as the `coin_auction_sequence` end date approaches.
The DAO then offers Product_Ticket🎫 in exchange for Work_Contract✍ signatures.

Once all of the Work_Contracts✍ have been signed, the DAO announces the first day of work for those willing to occupy the undeveloped land using tents or similar temporary structures while permanent shelter is being built.
At all times, but especially obvious during the startup stage, all occupants must receive a Basic Outcome insuring they can always wash, eat and sleep without money.

The DAO also issues Source_Titles🗂, each representing partial ownership in the entire supply-chain required to fulfill one specific Product_Ticket🎫.
As you fulfill your Work_Contracts✍, Source_Title🗂 ownership vests to you.

The specific Source_Titles🗂 that vest to you are those which were used in the production of the Product_Ticket🎫 you selected.
So, for example, if you selected a Product_Ticket🎫 representing a fruit pie, you would gain ownership in the fruit trees, grain fields, dairy cattle, etc. as you complete your work as, for example, a sanitation specialist.

You hold those Source_Titles🗂 to *automatically* own that future production.

Until all the work is automated,
You can do that work yourself or sign Work_Contracts✍ to compensate others.

"'Summary
The total number of tokens in circulation and their scarcity are critical for determining the value of a token.
There are two main limits to consider: the maximum number of tokens that will ever be released and how fast tokens are issued.
Consider what your tokens are exchangeable for, what they give access to, and what benefits the token holders might receive just for holding them.
Your tokens may be considered securities, access tokens, royalties, or may fall under other regulations.

The DAO asks for the price and size of real-estate currently "for sale".
The DAO mints 1 eC for each square_meter, then sells those coins to buy that land.

The DAO asks for people who want to occupy that land.
You may pass skill tests to qualify for Work_Contracts.
You may sign Work_Contracts to apply for occupancy.

The DAO asks for the Product_Tickets🎫 to be produced on that land.
You may sign a Work_Contract to "pay for" Product_Tickets🎫.

Once all Work_Contracts are signed, the DAO declares the first day of work.

The DAO must organize production so all occupants can wash, eat and sleep.

You gain land ownership as you complete Work_Contracts.

Group holdings may have recurring costs, usually payable in Work_Contracts.
