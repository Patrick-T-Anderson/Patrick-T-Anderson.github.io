<p class='main'><span class="h1">=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CityCoin — Public Goals through <a href="private.htm">Private</a> Property</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CityCoin is a claim over <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and services backed by the land and tools required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The CityCoin DAO issues and sells coins to acquire the property and promises to create more cities.<br/>
<br/>
Some users pay with plain-old-money used to buy the land and tools.<br/>
<br/>
While others commit to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to create the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Terms of Operation</span><br/>
Money becomes Property: Consumers pay early to own land and tools for food and home.<br/>
Property becomes <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t: Owners are consumers paying early for <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and services.<br/>
Promises become Property: <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers become owners as they complete <a href="work.htm">work</a> commitments.<br/>
Profit becomes Property: Consumers pay late to own when they buy surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Money becomes Property</span><br/>
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and services with plain-old-money, but instead of just receiving one round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, they become the real property owners of the land and tools that will be purchased for that <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This is fundamentally different from equity-based crowdfunding because of the reason investors are taking a risk.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the risk is made to as an investor to *avoid* paying profit, and as a consumer to ensure the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that <a href="good.htm">good</a> or services.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Property becomes <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t</span><br/>
Each owner accepts the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the direct and natural return on investment, thereby avoiding the usual selling and buying of the finished commodity.<br/>
<br/>
The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as an owner while the final sale is eliminated, leaving profit undefined.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of selling the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to another consumer, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has been pre-distributed to the consumer who predicted they would need it. There is no sale because it is already the individuated property of that consumer/owner.<br/>
<br/>
This allows groups to operate at zero profit even while all shareholders remain satisfied. Notice the numeric compensation is approximately the same as a For Profit investment, but inverted in that the consumer avoids paying profit for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Subgroups must be allowed to secede from the majority when the property is realistically divisible to promote localized control and inhibit Tyranny of the Majority.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Promises become Property</span><br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers invest when they commit to achieve <a href="work.htm">work</a> within the city.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is guaranteed access to Tier0 in return for immediate access to some* CityCoin titles vesting as those promises are completed, thereby avoiding excessive price and rent usually paid for food and housing.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is a consumer who must also own property to control the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts he must consume.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers promise to accomplish <a href="future.htm">future</a> goals and receive property as those promises are fulfilled. This replaces the rent or mortgage that would otherwise take most of the wages.<br/>
<br/>
Vested property can be used as collateral to access even more valuable property under this <a href="work.htm">work</a>-to-own scheme.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Profit becomes Property</span><br/>
Any owner may sell surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and even collect profit, but some of that profit must be invested for that very same paying user to buy newly issued CityCoin titles, or to buy CityCoin titles being offered for sale by other owners.<br/>
<br/>
This causes all users to incrementally gain the property ownership required to finally also control the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion they need and receive those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts at cost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Development Phases</span><br/>
PREBOOT<br/>
Search real estate listings to meet the many requirements such as: minimum size, maximum price, fitness for permaculture, zoning restrictions, water rights, mineral rights, taxes, fees, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Start crowdfunding pre-campaign to ask <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and other investor where they prefer to build.<br/>
<br/>
Finalize parcel selection and mint CityCoin against each square foot.<br/>
<br/>
BOOT<br/>
Start real crowdfunding campaign to begin selling CityCoin titles to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and other investors.<br/>
<br/>
Reach agreement over general structure of the city such as a central meeting place, major roads, nature preserves, strict borders, pollution restrictions, and any other constraints this group may decide to enforce upon itself.<br/>
<br/>
START<br/>
Purchase land, tools and startup supplies, including primary bulk food ingredients such as bushels of grains, legumes, raw potatoes, bales of herbs and spices etc. to cook large, cheap but nutritious shared meals and begin soap and cloth making.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers may move onsite immediately, but may need to use tents, cafeteria style dining and temporary sanitation facilities while the first shared structures are built and support services are established.<br/>
<br/>
Build first shared structures and install quickly-maturing plants and animals primarily for initial food <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
STASIS<br/>
&nbsp;The city can support Tier0 without external trade.<br/>
<br/>
Begin building <a href="private.htm">private</a> structures such as tiny houses.<br/>
<br/>
Install slow-maturing plants and animals with uses beyond food.<br/>
<br/>
SOVEREIGN<br/>
&nbsp;The city can support Tier1 without external trade.<br/>
<br/>
SURPLUS<br/>
The city <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es more than it consumes.<br/>
<br/>
Investment Types <small>(3 ways to pay)</small><br/>
1. Pay with commitments of plain-old-money to crowdfund the debt-free<br/>
&nbsp;purchase of real estate and tools from the regular market.<br/>
<br/>
2. Pay with commitments to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> for others within the city.<br/>
&nbsp;This cause you, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, to receive immediate access to enough<br/>
&nbsp;CityCoin titles to sustain at least Tier0 quality of life.<br/>
&nbsp;Vesting occurs as promises are kept, causing all <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to gain<br/>
&nbsp;debt-free housing and food security.<br/>
<br/>
3. Pay in a sort of ‘accidental’ way when you buy surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;from other owners and pay more than the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
&nbsp;Owners selling surplus are required to buy CityCoin titles with<br/>
&nbsp;some of their profits, and vest ownership of those titles to you,<br/>
&nbsp;the payer. //<small>[<small>[How should we determine the minimum percentage?]</small>]</small><br/>
<br/>
Commentary<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts<br/>
Each owner of Property is owner of <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in that same ratio.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you own 3% of the hives, you own 3% of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> honey.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and on the lifetime of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a young tree does not <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e fruit immediately, and the fruit is not fresh forever.<br/>
<br/>
CityCoin titles issued to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers may not vest if quality or quantity projections are not met. Projections must be adjusted for reasons outside the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er’s control such as such as severe weather, fire, earthquake, accidents, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Property<br/>
A variety of city design templates following permaculture principles could help guide core decisions around borders, roads, shared structures, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The market price of each newly issued CityCoin title is based on:<br/>
1. The market price of the Property required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
2. The inverse of the market price of the Promises required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This means those paying with plain-old-money are implicitly also buying *other* CityCoins used to compensate <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
For example, those paying for “1 Gallon of milk per month” must pay for the land and tools and <a href="work.htm">work</a> to build and run the dairy and tend to the cattle and Alfalfa and water rights, etc., recursively, for all that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The price of Promises is found through auction, increasing as the crowdfunding campaign end-date approaches.<br/>
<br/>
Each group must insure every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is qualified, especially for dangerous jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er must be able to commit the minimum Promises required to meet Tier0 quality of life else they cannot live onsite.<br/>
<br/>
Each owner must pay initial and recurring costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in one of these ways:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Supply Property or Promises for your portion of the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for this group.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Supply Property or Promises for your portion of the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion through another group which has a trade agreement with this group, and recursively, to any depth.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Sell <small>(or allow to be sold)</small> enough of your <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t to cover the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Secede from the group and retain your portion of the property under your own terms <small>(within the limits of realistic divisibility)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
For the safety of all citizens, every citizen must receive at least enough CityCoin titles to ensure Tier0 quality of life.<br/>
<br/>
Promises<br/>
Promises are commitments of <a href="future.htm">future</a> labor which are traded for Property under these terms, or for Promises from others to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for you in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you might commit to pick fruit in the orchard during harvest season, drive a bus during the week, and cook breakfast every other Sunday at one of the many restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
When CityCoin is purchased with Promises, it vests incrementally, as that <a href="work.htm">work</a> is completed.<br/>
<br/>
Trading <a href="work.htm">work</a> early in time, before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins, allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the “simultaneous coincidence of wants” problem that faces typical barter.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a real and direct insurance for each <a href="good.htm">good</a> and service <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in this way and inverts the usual incentives of scarcity and destruction toward our natural and original goals of abundance and permanent solutions.<br/>
<br/>
In the regular market, mechanics, plumbers and dentists need customers with broken cars, pipes, teeth to insure the tokens continue to flow. But if those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can instead commit “up front” to fix any trouble that might occur in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, they then hope you never have any trouble at all, since they have received your commitments either way.<br/>
<br/>
Automation and robots can be used to safely reduce <a href="work.htm">work</a> in this scenario because each group only wants the results.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a> is returned to it’s natural position as a problem we want to minimize instead of being a confused as social goal itself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone may apply for any job, but skill must proven and each group may enforce any other arbitrary requirements.<br/>
<br/>
A guild system might help determine <a href="work.htm">work</a>er skill levels and offer free access to educational media and paid apprenticeships. Guilds would protect owners by spreading quality and fulfillment risks across groups of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The job auction code needs to be written…<br/>
<br/>
Profit<br/>
Any owner may sell any amount of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t at any price, but some percentage of that Profit must be treated as an investment from that payer into issuing more CityCoin titles, or to buy CityCoin titles from others.<br/>
<br/>
This safely reduces Profit within the system as the Property required <a href="for product.htm">for product</a>ion is incrementally redistributed t<br/>
<br/>

Definitions<br/>
Property: All the land and tools and other non-human inputs needed to make a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
Promise : A commitment from a skilled human to achieve goals toward making a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t: A *projected* quantity and quality of some <a href="good.htm">good</a> or service across time.<br/>
Profit: Any amount paid by a consumer beyond the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
Costs: All Property and Promises actually consumed and all other externalities.<br/>
Surplus: Any amount of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t the current owner will not use directly.<br/>
