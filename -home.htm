<p class='main'>When I was young, I wondered how ants were able to organize their society so each had plenty of food and shelter while fly-covered children holding empty steel bowls kept interrupting my Satuday-morning cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
The TV asked for money to help, but surely the ants didn't have money, so what was their secret?<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Later I began reading and pondering the strange GNU <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> copyright license.<br/>
It requires every user gain access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they use.<br/>
But most users don't care about the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, so why would they need access?<br/>
<br/>
I thought about this for years.<br/>
What if you gained <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a fruit tree when you ate fruit?<br/>
<br/>
I finally realized this arrangement eliminates the usual need to buy those goods.<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a fruit tree does not fruit, he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it even before it is created!<br/>
Even if another person does the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, there is no sale, and so no profit.<br/>
This also reduces barrier-to-entry and promotes long term solutions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, but what about the poor <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers?<br/>
I eventually saw every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is also a consumer.<br/>
<br/>
They can gain <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es by trading services early.<br/>
This reduces the perceived need for jobs and promotes long term solutions.<br/>
