<p class='main'><img src=".img/-home.jpg" alt=""/>As a child, I wondered how ants organized society so each had plenty,<br/>
while the TV showed fly-covered children clenching empty steel bowls.<br/>
<br/>
The TV asked for money to help but surely the ants didn't have money.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Later I began reading and pondering the strange GNU <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> copyright license.<br/>
It requires every user gain access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they use.<br/>
But most users don't care about the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, so why would they need access?<br/>
<br/>
I thought about this for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a curious idea.<br/>
<br/>
It would be like gaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a fruit tree when you eat that fruit.<br/>
<br/>
I eventually saw this could <a href="work.htm">work</a> if the tree <a href="own.htm">own</a>er<br/>
used some of the profit you paid for those fruits<br/>
to buy even more <a href="land.htm">land</a> and trees and <a href="water.htm">water</a>-rights<br/>
required to grow even more fruit in the <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
and 'vest' those shares to you, the consumer.<br/>
<br/>
I finally realized this arrangement eventually<br/>
eliminates the usual need to buy those goods.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a tree does not buy that fruit,<br/>
he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it even before it has been picked!<br/>
<br/>
Even if others do all the <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
there is no sale and no profit.<br/>
<br/>
This reduces barrier-to-entry<br/>
and promotes permanence.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, but what about the poor <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers?<br/>
<br/>
Turns out every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is also a consumer of *something*.<br/>
So they also need <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to assure that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers gain sufficient access to <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es which vest as <a href="work.htm">work</a> is completed,<br/>
they acquire the <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership required to avoid profit, interest and rent.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers swap skills *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins,<br/>
they have incentive to build permanent solutions<br/>
since they are 'paid' by the agreement either way.<br/>
<br/>
