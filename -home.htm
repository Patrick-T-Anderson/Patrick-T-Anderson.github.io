<p class='main'><img src=".img/-home.jpg" alt=""/>As a child, I wondered how ants organized society so each had plenty,<br/>
while the TV showed fly-covered children clenching empty steel bowls.<br/>
<br/>
The TV asked for money to help but surely the ants didn't have money.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Later I discovered the GNU <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> Copyright license<br/>
and pondered how it seemed related to that issue.<br/>
<br/>
This strange legal instrument requires every <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t user<br/>
gain "at cost" access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But most users want nothing to do with <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, so why insure access?<br/>
<br/>
I thought about this for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a curious idea.<br/>
It would be like gaining üå≥ whenever you eat üçé.<br/>
But <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers cannot just give away <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es,<br/>
so where could this value come from?<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I learned about some problems in economics.<br/>
I eventually saw this could <a href="work.htm">work</a> if the tree <a href="own.htm">own</a>er<br/>
used some of the profit you paid for those fruits<br/>
to buy even more <a href="land.htm">land</a> and trees and <a href="water.htm">water</a>-rights<br/>
required to grow even more fruit in the <a href="future.htm">future</a><br/>
and 'vest' those shares to you, the consumer.<br/>
This arrangement incrementally eliminates<br/>
the usual need to purchase those goods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">"'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a tree does not buy that fruit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it even before it has been picked!<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
This also reduces barrier-to-entry<br/>
and promotes real permanence.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, but what about the poor <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers?<br/>
<br/>
Well, every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is also a consumer who<br/>
needs <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
We can use <a href="property.htm">property</a> rights and contract law<br/>
to build a GNU system where each has plenty<br/>
and controlled by those who need the results.<br/>
<br/>
