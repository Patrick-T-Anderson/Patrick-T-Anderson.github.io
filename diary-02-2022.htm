<br/>
Any <a href="org.htm">org</a> with Big <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y could help others avoid debt.<br/>
<br/>
For example, larger corporations could buy raw <a href="land.htm">land</a> without mortgage<br/>
and then vest <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who build an<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>ovillage there.<br/>
<br/>
By gaining real <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, every <a href="own.htm">own</a>er-occupant pays 0 rent!<br/>

Before gameplay begins, a RULESET is chosen or created<br/>
to define how COMPONENTS interact within that<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomy.<br/>
<br/>
COMPONENTS:<br/>

<br/>
Each RULESET is an opportunity for Token Engineers to set internal policy.<br/>
<br/>
RULESET choices:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> How is <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y issued?<br/>
1. In IRL, Federal Reserve Notes are Created as interest-bearing debt, not as Fiat, causing The Bank to eventually <a href="own.htm">own</a> most <a href="source title.htm">Source Title</a>s.<br/>
2. In Monopoly, <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is a debtless, true Fiat with unlimited supply <small>(the rules even say "The Bank" may create new <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y on any paper if <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed)</small>.<br/>
3. The <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> <a href="fun.htm">Fun</a>gible Token is issued without debt, but is not Fiat b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause it is strictly limited in supply by the number of square-meters of <a href="land.htm">land</a> on Earth.<br/>

2. In Monopoly it is *handed out* like UBI, every time you pass GO.<br/>
3. <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> is *sold* to buy <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> How are <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es acquired?<br/>
1. In IRL, Banks usually loan <small>(rent)</small> <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y to Players and <a href="group.htm">Group</a>s.<br/>
2. In Monopoly, if you can buy <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es from the UBI, you can charge rent.<br/>
3. In the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model, you gain <a href="source title.htm">Source Title</a>s as you complete <a href="work.htm">Work</a> Agreements.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> How is <a href="future.htm">Future</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="org.htm">org</a>anized?<br/>

2. In the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model it is <a href="org.htm">org</a>anized by the Players who want those results.<br/>

1. In IRL, Banks offer interest-bearing debt as loans or Mortgages.<br/>

<br/>
I grew up on a 640 acre farm in the Idaho desert.&nbsp;&nbsp;We grew Alfalfa and raised just enough Chickens, Cattle and Bees to have Eggs, Meat and Honey.<br/>
<br/>
After the farm I <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed construction, some of it overseas with <a class="ext" href="https://DomeTechnoloy.com">DomeTechnoloy.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I love <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing with my hands and usually able to solve almost any problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have repaired hundreds of small engines such as motorcycles and lawn mowers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was drawn to computer program<a href="min.htm">min</a>g <small>(Software Engineering)</small> b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause of the control it seemed to give me.<br/>
<br/>
But as began to realize we do not control our <a href="food.htm">food</a> systems, I have refocused my goals to be dir<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tly involved in permaculture.<br/>

The <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model conflicts with the usual approach of "financial <a href="return.htm">return</a>s", yet it is provably *just as eff<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive for each shareholder* in a strange, sort of **inverted** manner as you <a href="own.htm">own</a> shares to **avoid** paying the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> you would otherwise pay when buying that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from the regular market.<br/>
<br/>
It is a <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>damentally different *reason* to co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> and farms and factories and all the infrastructure we already pay for as consumers.<br/>
<br/>
We can <a href="own.htm">own</a> these <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive assets **b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause we <a href="need.htm">need</a> the results** to finally regain control of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eive those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts at the true cost of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we, as consumers, already pay all the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(and even more when we pay <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, so it is easy to see we could afford to be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It is common to assume such <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would require those consumers to be the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but I don't understand this stance since we <a href="own.htm">own</a> shares "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" without being the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, so why can we not <a href="own.htm">own</a> shares "<a href="for product.htm">for product</a>" without being the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers?<br/>
<br/>
This is actually just one part of a more comprehensive approach that prot<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ts the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in a profoundly deep way by first r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ognizing every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is a *consumer* of many different goods and services, then, using that information, we insure each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er gains real <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">land</a> required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the goods and services they <a href="need.htm">need</a> to *consume*.<br/>
<br/>
So in the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ome <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers **as consumers**, both to avoid paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, and also to have the ultimate say in how those things are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er gains real <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="water.htm">water</a>-rights and <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s, etc. required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all of the things they <a href="need.htm">need</a> to consume.<br/>
<br/>
This causes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, rent and interest to safely approach zero even while all of these sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ial consumer+shareholders are satisfied as <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is used to **prot<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t** them from paying more than the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But even more profoundly, this approach finally eli<a href="min.htm">min</a>ates the usual '<a href="need.htm">need</a>' for market scarcity since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself is never sold <small>(except surplus)</small>, b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause each consumer+shareholder of "beehives" accepts the "honey" itself as the natural <a href="return.htm">return</a>-on-investment.<br/>
<br/>
This allows us to ignore market <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and removes the usual temptation to use artificial scarcity to increase <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">"'They stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screa<a href="min.htm">min</a>g pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop d<a href="own.htm">own</a> to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>wing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>wing heavy, <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>wing heavy for the vintage.'"</span> -- The Grapes of Wrath<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we do not address this issue, we will never be able to achieve the true <a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance we seek b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> actually **requires** scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y, governments have made many laws <small>(for example <a class="ext" href="https://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">https://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws</a> )</small> to prop-up <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es to 'prot<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t' the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who intend to sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(such as <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>)</small> for more than the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We are so accustomed to this approach that it is hard to imagine any other reason to <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But imagine a bizarre corporation that is wholly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the consumers of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that will be created **and** these strange consumer+shareholders do not *buy* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from the coll<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive others, but instead simply accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the natural ROI.<br/>
<br/>
This approach **only** <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for goods and services we can *predict* we will <a href="need.htm">need</a>, but the fortunate thing there is that most '<a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial' goods and services are easily predicted.<br/>

While the former tracks but a single metric <small>(“<a href="work.htm">work</a>” or “stake”)</small> SEEDS Contribution Scores track a myriad <small>(and continually expanding)</small> set of metrics and contributions as detailed throughout this s<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The CS of an account deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>es the Trust Tokens <small>(voice)</small> r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eived for governance d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>isions <small>(for Citizens)</small> and the share of the Harvest <small>(new Seeds)</small> r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eived <small>(for Residents and Citizens)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Proof of Stake of 1-token=1-vote/reward.<br/>
<br/>
In Proof of Stake net<a href="work.htm">work</a>s if an account has staked 50% of the tokens, they’d get 50% of the rewards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“staking” tokens in other block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> protocols;<br/>

Participating in d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ision making via casting or delegating Trust Tokens in SEEDS Governance.<br/>
Members may earn Reputation for participating in d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ision making <small>(voting and delegating Trust)</small>. See S<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tion 2 on governance for more details on Trust tokens, delegation and voting.<br/>
Cast/Delegate your Trust Tokens, Pass Proposals, Earn Reputation Points<br/>
Cast Your Trust Tokens<br/>
Members earn <small>[N]</small> Reputation Points for casting any Trust Tokens during a cycle.<br/>
Cast Your Trust Tokens<br/>
Members earn <small>[N]</small>% of the Reputation Points that the Citizen they delegated their Trust Tokens to r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eived in a cycle.<br/>
Members earn <small>[N]</small>% of the reputation from every account that has delegated their Trust <small>(governance token)</small> to them and they participate in governance that cycle.<br/>
Reputation disproportionately <small>(versus the other metrics)</small> aff<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ts the total Seeds and Trust Tokens <small>(governance token)</small> an account earns.<br/>
Regardless of how wealthy <small>(<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>onomic volume and planted Seeds)</small> an account is, if they have a negative or 0 reputation score they would earn no rewards <small>(Harvest)</small> and gain no Trust Tokens <small>(governance tokens)</small>. This gives the Citizens a <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> to defend the<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomy from a variety of attack v<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tors.<br/>
Ratings Tokens System <small>[2.0 Feature]</small><br/>
Provide “Ratings Tokens” that Members <a href="need.htm">need</a> to spend to give a rating. This introduces an opportunity to more deeply consider a rating as it comes with an opportunity cost and may result in more accurate and thoughtful ratings.<br/>
Rating tokens are provided at the start of each cycle equal to the Members Contribution Scores. <br/>
If a Member gives +7 they would send 7 of their rating tokens; if they give a -4 they send 4 ratings tokens to the <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisations. <br/>
Badges are sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ial tokens and contracts within SEEDS that confer sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ific rights upon the bearer.<br/>
This is a badge that is issued to an <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisation when 3 <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisations who hold this badge vouch for another <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisation to be a “Rating <a href="org.htm">Org</a>”. <a href="org.htm">Org</a>anisations holding this token <small>(badge)</small> are able to rate other <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisations. At any time Citizens are able to remove these <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisations’ badges through utilizing the “Flag” feature. <br/>
2.2 Trust Tokens Distribution and Design<br/>
2.2 Trust Tokens Distribution and Design<br/>
Trust Token Distribution Table<br/>
Global Trust Token Distribution<br/>
Trust Tokens are distributed equal to the Contribution Score of the Citizen. <br/>
E.g. a score of 95 will provide 95 Trust Tokens to that Citizen.<br/>
Regional Trust Token Distribution<br/>
Trust Tokens are distributed equal to the Contribution Score of the Citizen. <br/>
E.g. a score of 95 will provide 95 Trust Tokens to that Citizen.<br/>
Each Citizen may obtain voting rights through r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eiving Trust Tokens relative to their Contribution Scores. These Trust Tokens are distributed once per cycle.<br/>
Each Citizen earns Trust Tokens for each category of governance operations in the SEEDS Global and the Region in which they are Members. <br/>
&nbsp;<small>[%]</small> of Trust Tokens cast delegatee = <small>[%]</small> of Trust Tokens cast of delegator<br/>
If a delegate casts 1/10 of their Trust Tokens on a proposal it triggers a matching vote of 1/10 of the Trust Tokens of the delegator.<br/>
A citizen can choose their top 2 favourite permaculture practitioners to delegate to and give each one of them 50% of their Trust Tokens <small>(or 60/40… 70/30… 33/33/34… etc)</small>.<br/>
Distributing Trust Tokens in a percen<a href="tile.htm">tile</a> distribution pattern is designed to move beyond Plutocratic or “Mob Rule” approaches to democracy. SEEDS provides a foundation to a more equitable distribution of voice to Citizens by tracking a wider diversity of participation <small>(Contribution Scores)</small> beyond token holdings alone, or 1-Citizen-1-vote. <br/>
Trust <small>(governance tokens)</small> cannot be obtained with wealth alone <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing Seeds tokens or purchasing Trust tokens)</small>. This is a departure from most crypto governance designs that have a governance token that can be bought and sold, creating pure plutocracies <small>(governance by the wealthy)</small>. <br/>
Citizens have until <small>[N]</small> in the voting cycle in order to cast their Trust Tokens without Trust depr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iation.. <br/>
<small>[N]</small>% of total Trust Tokens are removed every 24 hours following the <small>[Trust Depr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iation Start]</small> mark<br/>
If Trust Tokens have not been cast by the ‘trust depr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iation start” time, then a linear deterioration starts until they reset by the start of the next voting cycle. Trust tokens will be re<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed for the next voting cycle.<br/>
If Mary has 80 Trust Tokens at the start of the cycle when the deterioration starts she will have 40 Trust Tokens half way through the deterioration and just a few Trust Tokens by the last day before the next cycle. <br/>
A Member immediately r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eives Trust Tokens upon evolution to a Citizen to use during that cycle. The depr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iation of Trust tokens is applied retroactively. <br/>
Jane evolved to a Citizen during the s<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ond half of a cycle; she'll get a depr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iated amount of tokens relative to the point in the cycle and her Contribution Score.<br/>
# of Trust Tokens cast in favour <small>(Trusted)</small> ÷ Trust Tokens casted on proposal<br/>
# of Trust Tokens cast in favour <small>(Trusted)</small> <br/>
Total Trust Tokens cast in favour on all proposals in the same category and cycle<br/>
<small>[N]</small>% Proportion of Trust Tokens in Favour vs Against<br/>
# of Trust Tokens cast in favour <small>(Trusted)</small> <br/>
Total Trust Tokens cast on proposal <br/>
In the event more <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ding proposals passed than the budget can afford then proposals will be paid out prioritised by the number of Trust Tokens r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eived. <br/>
Citizens can have their stake <a href="return.htm">return</a>ed and close their proposal. Alternatively, Citizens can opt to have their proposal repeated next month. This will reset all Trust Tokens gained.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the proposal fails to get <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ding in the s<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ond cycle, the proposal will be considered failed, and the Citizen will lose their proposal fee. <br/>
Citizens are given Trust Tokens unique for each proposal <small>(to vote for or against)</small>. <br/>
However, this doesn’t come without cost. The tokens, accounts, badges, Seeds and other block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> data would be different from the main SEEDS block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> <small>(think Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash)</small> and the new one. So, this new fork would require applications, exchanges and other <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s accessing the net<a href="work.htm">work</a> to adopt this new Block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> for it to have any meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTE: THE FOLLOWING PROTOCOLS DON’T TAKE EFF<a href="ec.htm">EC</a>T UNTIL AFTER “GO LIVE” HAS BEEN TRIGGERED BY THE CITIZENS. BEFORE THAT EVENT, SEEDS IS A FIXED SUPPLY CURRENCY AND BEHAVE AS DETAILED IN THE TOKEN ALLOCATION AND<a href="ec.htm"> EC</a>ONOMICS PAPER<br/>
3.4.1 Gratitude Token<br/>
3.4.2 <a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance Token<br/>
Adding the tokens taken out of circulation and <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>tracting the tokens brought into circulation from the <a href="gro.htm">Gro</a>ss Harvest suggestion creates the “Net Harvest”. Seeds are created <small>[each hour]</small> and sent dir<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tly to accounts following the Harvest distribution.<br/>
These <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ds are reserved for maintaining the Seed Bank and purchasing the underlying block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> tokens <small>(TLOS)</small> to reserve adequate bandwidth to maintain SEEDS net<a href="work.htm">work</a> bandwidth. <br/>
3.4.1 Gratitude Token<br/>
This token means nothing if kept <small>(as next cycle it will reset)</small> and only means something once it's given away <small>(a compliment is only valuable when shared)</small>. Gratitude is allocated by means of an “acknowledgement” action, that will not sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ify the exact amount of tokens being shared, being limited to ~<small>[N]</small> of the total gratitude that the account has. To better use all tokens, Members are r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ommended to acknowledge at least N times per cycle <small>(configured on <small>[<a class="ext" href="https://gratz.acks">gratz.acks</a>]</small> setting)</small>, and the exact token value <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferred is calculated just at the end of the cycle, based on the number of acknowledgements <small>(acks)</small> each Member made.<br/>
At the end of the cycle, the Seeds amount allocated on the Gratitude contract will be split to all Gratitude Members based on their proportional shares, just before resetting all Gratitude tokens.<br/>
Gratitude Token Table<br/>
Each Resident gets <small>[N]</small> Gratitude tokens as a base distribution at the start of each cycle. <br/>
Each Citizen gets <small>[N]</small> Gratitude tokens as a base distribution at the start of each cycle. <br/>
All Seeds in this account will be equally distributed amongst gratitude token <small>(Gratz)</small> holders.<br/>
3.4.2 <a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance Token <small>[2.0 Feature]</small><br/>
The escrowed Seeds release schedule is designed to reduce sale pressure as escrowed Seeds come into circulation to meet new demand as the SEEDS<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomy <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>ws. This encourages a more stable value for Seeds and benefits all participants by removing the often-experienced mass “sell off” of tokens in various crypto<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomic experiments. This mutually beneficial game-dynamic encourages a more stable value for Seeds as they’re released. <br/>
The Seed Bank is also a powerful <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> Citizens can leverage to build alliances with other<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>osystems. The assets the Citizens choose to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e in the Seed Bank are benefited by being held and locked out of circulation by the Bank. This benefits tokens designed to appr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iate in value. <br/>
For example a re<a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erative token backing man<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>ve reforestation that’s designed to appr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iate in value as carbon credits are paid to the holders and more forests are re<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>wn. This token would be an ideal candidate for the Seed Bank.<br/>
The Re<a href="gen.htm">gen</a> DEX is a <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> for Members to exchange value dir<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tly <small>(without a middleman)</small> amongst each other with a variety of tokens and d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>entralised <small>(on-<a href="chain.htm">chain</a>)</small> currencies and assets. Members can create <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisation, village, team or other types of tokens and swap value with people across the globe.<br/>
For example members may swap Seeds with Hypha <small>(Hypha Value Token)</small> or HUSD <small>(a USD Stable token)</small> and a variety of other tokens that Members chose to support using this <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>.<br/>
Tokens<br/>
Tokens help Members create new methods of tracking, exchanging, and distributing information and value. <br/>
There are 3 main types of tokens within SEEDS:<br/>
Trust Tokens<br/>
Trust tokens give Members a <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> to more accurately and equitably distribute voice amongst each-other. <br/>
Since each Member contributes and is committed to SEEDS at varying degrees <small>(and thus variably aff<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ted by the <a href="outcom.htm">outcom</a>es of d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>isions made within SEEDS)</small> Trust Tokens are a <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> to more equitably track and distribute voice based on levels of contribution.<br/>
Value Exchange and Coordination Tokens<br/>
Members gain access to a variety of “tokens” within SEEDS to track, exchange and coordinate value flows. <br/>
Seeds Tokens<br/>
Gratitude Tokens<br/>
<a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance Tokens <small>[2.0 Feature]</small><br/>
<a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance is another <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> and exploration into radically redesigning how value is distributed. <a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance tokens can be earned through a multitude of Citizen chosen actions. Such as paying more than the average <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e when using the <a href="gift.htm">Gift</a><a href="ec.htm"> Ec</a>onomy API.<br/>
More Tokens To Be Co-Created…<br/>
The <a href="gift.htm">Gift</a><a href="ec.htm"> Ec</a>onomy API gives Members a <a href="tool.htm">tool</a> to create hybrid markets. Members are able to buy and sell re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es using a ‘sliding scale’ that can go from 0 to any value <small>(either getting it cheaper if they <a href="need.htm">need</a>, or paying excess to earn other benefits like <a href="abund.htm">Abund</a>ance tokens)</small>. <br/>
For those that pay more than the average <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, they earn an equal amount of “<a href="abund.htm">abund</a>ance tokens” for those that pay less, the seller earns these tokens.<br/>
It provides Members an ability to hold their appr<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iating crypto-assets while still gaining access to an optimal medium-of-exchange <small>(Seeds)</small> to make their regular purchases with <small>(e.g. you could get a low interest Seeds loan by collateralising your <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisations asset tokens)</small>.<br/>
An action of entrusting another account with dir<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ting your Trust Tokens.<br/>
One who r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eives the delegation of Trust Tokens from another Citizen.<br/>
One who delegates their Trust Tokens to another Citizen. <br/>
Name of the currency used by the SEEDS<a href="ec.htm"> Ec</a>osystem. Divisible to four d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>imal points. Use interchangeably with ‘token’.<br/>
Tokens<br/>
Trust Token<br/>
SEEDS d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ouples equity tokens and Trust <small>(voice)</small> tokens. In today’s do<a href="min.htm">min</a>ant paradigm “<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y talks” and simply by virtue of having <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, one could buy up a majority voice in any <a href="org.htm">org</a>anisation. This is true of many crypto-proj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ts as well. If we’re to build a system that can’t be co-opted or corrupted by our do<a href="min.htm">min</a>ant paradigm, we cannot allow legacy value to buy governance in SEEDS. For this reason, Seeds are not what is counted when weighing voice, but rather the number of Trust Tokens an account has earned. Trust is earned through participation and contribution, where <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y committed is but one metric and not the whole <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y.<br/>
SEEDS uses nomenclature and models found in our legacy nation-states to ease the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ition into SEEDS - further, many <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ctions of our societies today play important roles that can be remodelled to serve us better. One of those <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ctions is the process by which a person can join a new society <small>(or nation-state)</small>. The barrier to b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ome a Visitor is extremely low, allowing you to come and experience what SEEDS can offer. When you b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ome a Resident, you begin earning a Harvest and increase your allocated <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>action volume based on how many Seeds you have planted. After you gain your citizenship, you unlock further abilities to increase your Harvest and begin earning Trust Tokens to participate in governance. <br/>
