Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
I fell in love with distributed <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age while <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing at <a href="stor.htm">Stor</a>ageCraft.<br/>
<br/>
I have reviewed many of the current competitors but most of them do not achieve true peer to peer data persistence for all devices.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what we <a href="need.htm">need</a> is:<br/>
<br/>
Every node must be allowed to participate as a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age provider at any quality of service level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider IOT devices sharing kilobytes.<br/>
<br/>
Nodes must be allowed to reciprocate <small>(pay)</small> for data persistence by offering some of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age <small>(often from another device on the same account)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Increased data persistence through multiple physically separated copies which are automatically 'reseeded' as nodes fail.<br/>

Hi all, just wanted to give some context and help explain the purpose of the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model.<br/>
<br/>
In 1999, as a young father, I suddenly realized I had no control of the <a href="food.htm">food</a> we <a href="need.htm">need</a>.<br/>
<br/>
After struggling alone in a garden, I stepped back and wondered "Why can't we <a href="org.htm">org</a>anize in <a href="group.htm">group</a>s for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit?".<br/>
<br/>
A regular business <a href="org.htm">org</a>anizes <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of shareholders and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but if you "hold shares" in a restaurant, you are not a real <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and so the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e you pay is the same as any other customer, which is <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erally more than if you had prepared the meal in isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers do not "have enough <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y" to be shareholders, and also rarely could afford to eat where they <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So I began a quest to discover the origin and purpose of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, and found there are many theories , but no proof <a class="ext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics)</a><br/>
<br/>
After some time I realized there are two, very different 'economies'.<br/>
1. Business as Usual: When you <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(such as an Apple tree)</small> *to sell the results*, you may be concerned if there is an abundance of Apples, because the scarcity of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(<a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erally)</small> increases the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, and so abundance can be 'dangerous'.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> By the way, many blamed <small>[over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion]</small><small>(<a class="ext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction)</a> for 1930's "Great Depression" in the US.</span><br/>
<br/>
2. Home Economics: When you <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(such as an Apple tree)</small> *to consume the results*, you do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(Apples)</small> from yourself, because they are yours *already*, and so the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e you pay as a consumer is exactly the costs you paid as an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> simply does not exist, because the final <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>action <small>(of purchasing the Apple)</small> has been eli<a href="min.htm">min</a>ated.<br/>
<br/>
Most business <small>(even non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s)</small> are structured to sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and so cannot ignore <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, and <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erally *fear* abundance because they may not even be able to "recover the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion".<br/>
<br/>
Most home gardens are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the few people who will use those results, so those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can *ignore* the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and laugh at abundance since it cannot harm them.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model applies the structure of Home Economics to **<a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s** to build <a href="min.htm">Min</a>imum Viable Villages, each under the direct control of those occupant-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
To do this, we must change how we fund, <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="own.htm">own</a>, and govern real <a href="property.htm">property</a>.<br/>
<br/>
1. We separate funding from <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership by selling a Fungible Token <small>(coin)</small> to those with deep pockets <small>(you might say whales)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like bitcoin, this coin represents no utility, no governance and no <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, so we can safely sell it to the highest bidder without concern.<br/>
<br/>
2. We re-connect 'buying' with '<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing' by trading "<a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion" <small>(called <a href="product ticket.htm">Product Ticket</a>s)</small> for "<a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>" <small>(called <a href="work contract.htm">Work Contract</a>s)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means you can be poor <small>(and even in debt)</small> and still join by simply* committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3. We re-connect <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing by vesting real <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to those who complete <a href="work contract.htm">Work Contract</a>s. You receive the results of the <a href="product ticket.htm">Product Ticket</a>s you selected and also <small>(slowly)</small> receive the <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights and other Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion used to deliver those goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, and especially during the "BOOT" stage, each occupant must receive a "Basic <a href="outcom.htm">Outcom</a>e" of <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial goods and services until the onsite <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is fully operational.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those costs are included when setting the <a href="min.htm">min</a>imum_bid of the coin for that parcel.<br/>
<br/>
4. We change *why* you are a "shareholder" <small>(but actually a real <a href="own.htm">own</a>er)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive assets to *avoid* paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> or rent to other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and rent to safely approach zero for predictable goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
5. We re-connect governance with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership by enabling occupants to directly control the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion using a map-like interface where you may 'vote' for changes you would like to see on <a href="land.htm">land</a> that you <a href="own.htm">own</a> <small>(personal)</small> or co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> <small>(in a <a href="group.htm">group</a>, or in <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s, or <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s of <a href="group.htm">group</a>s, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
6. As an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, when selling surplus, you may charge any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, but, some <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> must be invested *for the consumer who paid it*.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes all users to eventually gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership required to also regain control of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the GNU <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> Copyright license's requirement that every user gain access to the "<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es" of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they use.<br/>

Part of the terror in "The Ter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ator" is the ultra-alpha indestructability faced on the play<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und by all who are not part of the bully's crew.<br/>
<br/>
The Ter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ator, as a true Lone Wolf, is sold as being even more of a success than a squadron.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be interpreted as an obvious block by the B<a href="org.htm">org</a> which must not have us <a href="org.htm">org</a>anize, lest we break our bonds.<br/>
<br/>
Of course The B<a href="org.htm">org</a> is partly fictional, but also not *entirely* fictional.<br/>
<br/>
It appears in many stylized forms as it coaxes us into a state of acceptance to fulfill the fate it has crafted for us.<br/>
<br/>
And so we see the glorification of the solitary solutionist: MacGyver, et al, but also the many forms of the "gun hero", not only the obvious "Dirty Harry" and so many other 'cop' movies, but also a long hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y of Westerns.<br/>
<br/>
So even with a partner <small>(often as an insultingly inferior 'sidekick')</small> there was much dismay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the Batman/Robin *SLAP*, or the excruciating relationship between the Lone Ranger and Tonto.<br/>
<br/>
In many 'cop' movies, the Hero reports to "The Chief" <small>(ancient power title...)</small> in a way that often showed in<a href="sub.htm">sub</a>ordination to reify the power of the solitary solutionist.<br/>
<br/>
This vision of "violence as a solution" is sold as a pathway to achieve <br/>
