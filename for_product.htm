This document is under construction<br/>
Overview<br/>
The For_<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t development model changes why we share <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and how we trade <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
We share <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for the somewhat <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>versive reason that we want to avoid paying Rent*.<br/>
<br/>
We trade <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s indir<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tly as we sign <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s to "pay for" <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This enables full sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ialization for predictable goods and services without the <a href="need.htm">need</a> for barter.<br/>
<br/>
As you complete <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s, you gain <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, etc.)</small>, and then hodl that <a href="property.htm">property</a> to <a href="own.htm">own</a> those predicted goods and services without purchase!<br/>
<br/>
Just as when you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a tree, you <a href="own.htm">own</a> the fruit,<br/>
When you co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> a forest, you co-<a href="own.htm">own</a> the fruit.<br/>
This strategy, borrowed from the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, frees Users by ensuring access to <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
Use the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, ****!<br/>
We can <a href="own.htm">own</a> the INPUTS b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause we <a href="need.htm">need</a> the OUTPUTS to ensure any predictable good or service and regain control of those supply <a href="chain.htm">chain</a>s.<br/>

DAO: A simple interface to manage these legal instruments.<br/>
Timeline<br/>
The DAO asks for <a href="land.htm">land</a> suitable to build <a href="min.htm">Min</a>imum Viable Villages.<br/>
The DAO begins the coin_auction_sequence at that <a href="min.htm">min</a>imum_bid.<br/>
The DAO <a href="min.htm">min</a>ts <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ific to that location.<br/>
The DAO asks for the <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s to fulfill all <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s.<br/>
For each parcel, the DAO begins the <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> coin_auction_sequence, offering ½ of the supply for that parcel.<br/>
After 24 hours, or until <a href="min.htm">min</a>imum_bid is met, the DAO then offers ½ of the remaining <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a>, and so on until the supply for that parcel is sold.<br/>
<a href="min.htm">min</a>imum_bid of each <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> is set by <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>_<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e + startup_costs)</small> / M².<br/>
startup_costs include:<br/>
<a href="tool.htm">Tool</a>s and supplies required for Day1 of occupation.<br/>
<a href="tool.htm">Tool</a>s and supplies for shared meals.<br/>
Temporary structures while first permanent structures are built.<br/>
<a href="tool.htm">Tool</a>s and supplies required to fulfill all <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s we do not yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
Fees and Taxes of the host governments.<br/>
Meanwhile…<br/>
For each listing, the DAO begins the <a href="work.htm">work</a>_auction_sequence, offering all jobs at a Compensation Ratio of 1.<br/>
After 24 hours, or until ½ of the <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s are signed, the Compensation Ratio increases for all remaining jobs.<br/>
<a href="fun.htm">Fun</a> and easy jobs may auction quickly, at a lower Compensation Ratios, while un<a href="fun.htm">fun</a> and high-<a href="skill.htm">skill</a> jobs may auction slowly, at higher Compensation Ratios.<br/>
If both auctions succeed, the DAO buys the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>lares the first day of <a href="work.htm">work</a>!<br/>
Meanwhile…<br/>
The DAO <a href="min.htm">min</a>ts the <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s&nbsp;&nbsp;used to fulfill all <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s being fulfilled at that location.<br/>
The DAO vests <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s as <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s are fulfilled.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Terms<br/>
You may propose any real-estate listing to the DAO.<br/>
You may buy any amount of <a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<a href="earthchange.htm">earthChange</a> does not represent <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and conveys no rights of governance and is not redeemable for any good or service.<br/>
You may apply for occupancy.<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_Occupant must:<br/>
Sign a <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a> to fulfill part of an <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>. OR Relinquish some <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s which will be sold to cover <a href="recur.htm">recur</a>ring costs.<br/>
Gain <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s as they fulfill <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the DAO must vest <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, <a href="min.htm">min</a>eral rights, etc. to you, as you complete the <a href="work.htm">work</a> you agreed to do.<br/>
The <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a> "gain rate" d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>reases as your total <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the 'poor' <small>(those who <a href="own.htm">own</a> the least)</small> gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership much faster than the 'rich' <small>(those who <a href="own.htm">own</a> the most)</small>.<br/>
Invest some <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> "for the user who paid it".&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you have extra Honey at the end of the year, you may offer it to others, with no limit on the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e you may charge, but some of that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> must buy even more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and those new <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s must vest to the person who paid that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes all users to gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the goods and services they <a href="need.htm">need</a>.<br/>
Gain personal <a href="property.htm">property</a> <small>(maybe even Sole Proprietorship)</small> of all of the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> Titles, <a href="water.htm">Water</a> Rights and <a href="min.htm">Min</a>eral Rights required to maintain a <a href="private.htm">private</a> dwelling and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e bare n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essities in isolation.<br/>
Gain <a href="group.htm">Group</a>-of-<a href="group.htm">Group</a>s <a href="property.htm">property</a> at the MVV level b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause of roads and borders.<br/>
Allowed to <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>tly exclude, to help each Person find their best <a href="group.htm">Group</a>, and each <a href="group.htm">Group</a> find their best <a href="group.htm">Group</a>_of_<a href="group.htm">Group</a>s, etc.<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_Occupant may:<br/>
Hold <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s <small>(such as a Tree)</small> to hold <a href="future.htm">future</a> goods <small>(such as Fruit)</small>.<br/>
Hold <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a> signatures of others to hold <a href="future.htm">future</a> services <small>(picking Fruit)</small>.<br/>
Propose new <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s for any good or service you can imagine.<br/>
Sign <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s to buy <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s.<br/>
Sell <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s for <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
Buy <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, if being offered.<br/>
Govern <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion through the <a href="changemaker.htm">ChangeMaker</a> grid.<br/>
Require <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers adhere to arbitrary rules.<br/>
Gain <a href="group.htm">Group</a> <a href="property.htm">property</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(maybe a variation of Tenancy in Common)</small>.<br/>
Each DAO should offer <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er Guilds to ease onboarding and increase <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a> fulfillment by spreading risk across <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="group.htm">group</a>s.<br/>
<a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a> allocation <small>(the actual location of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> you r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eive)</small> is based on the <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s you chose, not the <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s you fulfill.<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er_occupied- core <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erates no financial <a href="return.htm">return</a>s as <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s are redeemed except when surplus is sold for <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
In 'hybrid' mode, some <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> may be used to pay traditional inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s.<br/>
Each <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a> represents a single instance of a sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ific good or service, and therefore requires unique <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s and <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
Each <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a> is initially-invalid and finally-expiring, with a "Window of Validity" defined by real limitations of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age required for that good or service.<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er_occupant must gain the <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e a Basic <a href="outcom.htm">Outcom</a>e.<br/>
The maximum <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s per <a href="own.htm">own</a>er_occupant is limited by the <a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s required by others.<br/>

Commentary<br/>
Comparisons<br/>
Value Flow<br/>
In the usual vision of a "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed" supply-<a href="chain.htm">chain</a>, each stage of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the people who operate those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t must be sold at each stage.<br/>
For example, the farmer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="grain.htm">grain</a> field, sells the <a href="grain.htm">grain</a> to the <a href="mill.htm">mill</a>er who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="mill.htm">mill</a>, who sells flour to the baker who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the bakery - who then sells the finished <a href="bread.htm">bread</a> back to the farmer and <a href="mill.htm">mill</a>er.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
However, in the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model, entire, vertically-integrated supply <a href="chain.htm">chain</a>s are <small>(eventually)</small> co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the consumers who <a href="need.htm">need</a> those final <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the materials used to create those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are then never bought nor sold b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause each portion is already the <a href="property.htm">property</a> of those who will use it.<br/>
The Farmer, <a href="mill.htm">Mill</a>er, and Baker each <a href="own.htm">own</a> a % of the farm, <a href="mill.htm">mill</a>, and bakery.<br/>
The % they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> is, based on the amount of <a href="future.htm">future</a> 🥖 they will want.<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>s that % of <a href="grain.htm">grain</a>, flour and 🥖 as it flows through the supply <a href="chain.htm">chain</a>.<br/>
<a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of that material remains in the hands of the consumer. <br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er accepts the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the natural ROI and thereby avoids paying the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> they would have otherwise paid if they had bought those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from the regular market.<br/>
Since there is no final sale, the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e each pays as a consumer is simply the costs each paid as a co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is left undefined.<br/>
By holding <a href="property.htm">property</a> in this way, and by trading <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, we can ensure any predictable good or service.<br/>

Distribute Universal Tokens to each <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a> holder.<br/>
The Conflict<br/>
When we <a href="own.htm">own</a> “<a href="for product.htm">for product</a>”, such as within a home, we can use <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a> to meet our <a href="need.htm">need</a>s at the real costs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But when we <a href="own.htm">own</a> "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>", we cannot meet our <a href="need.htm">need</a>s at cost b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause stockholders demand a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> on their investments.<br/>
<br/>
Bob Parr <small>{on the right}</small> <small>(Customer Support for InsuraCare)</small> --&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>[somber, thoughtful]</small>:<br/>
"We are supposed to help people."<br/>
<br/>
Gilbert Huph <small>(Bob's Boss)</small> -- <small>[angry, pleading]</small>:<br/>
"We are supposed to help OUR people, starting with our Stockholders, Bob!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So it seems customers and stockholders must be forever at odds on the quest for a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But hold on, what is a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does this value come from?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe we should ask "When does this value disappear?".&nbsp;&nbsp;In mathematical terms we are asking "What is the zero of this <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ction?".<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you "invest in real-estate" to <a href="own.htm">own</a> a home b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause you <a href="need.htm">need</a> a place to live, the <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> <small>(rent)</small> does not exist b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause you do not send a bill to yourself!<br/>
<br/>
If we <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>eralize this idea to all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion we can imagine each customer of every <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial good and service as a tiny stockholder <small>(steak🥩holder)</small> in the many businesses <small>(<a href="group.htm">group</a>s)</small> required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
Each customer+stockholder does not pay a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a>, nor are they paid a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause that flow of value has been canceled out, and does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
This means these sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are satisfied that they avoided paying the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> they would have otherwise paid if they had purchased that good or service from the regular market.<br/>
<br/>
For example, imagine Alice invests a very small amount <small>(perhaps within a "mutual <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>d")</small> in a regular, "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" dairy corresponding to 1 gallon of Milk per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount she would r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eive from that investment would be the amount some customer <small>(possibly even herself)</small> will finally pay for that gallon of Milk beyond the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as a stockholder, she r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eives the <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> paid by the consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, imagine Henry invests the same amount in a "<a href="for product.htm">for product</a>" dairy b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause he predicts he will use 1 gallon of Milk per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while Alice r<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>eives that value as a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> on her investment, Henry avoids paying that value as his <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> on investment. <br/>
<br/>
Of course this only applies to goods and services we can predict we will want in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, such as basic <a href="need.htm">need</a>s like <a href="food.htm">food</a> and shelter.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="bread.htm">Bread</a><a href="land.htm">land</a>ia<br/>
A toy<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomy, where 🥖 is the only <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
If using the <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a> model, the Farmer, <a href="mill.htm">Mill</a>er, and Baker would each <a href="own.htm">own</a> a <small>(likely unequal)</small> % of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>{farm, <a href="mill.htm">mill</a>, bakery}</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The % of 🥖 they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> is the same % of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es they each <a href="own.htm">own</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the % of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> is based on the amount they 🥖 they predicted they would want.<br/>
<br/>
Since these consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the intermediate materials <small>{<a href="grain.htm">grain</a>, flour, 🥖}</small> remains in the hands of each of those consumers, as it flows through the supply <a href="chain.htm">chain</a> and is never sold <small>(unless selling surplus to others)</small>, and so cannot <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erate a <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause the final customer already <a href="own.htm">own</a>s those results. <br/>
<br/>
This is vertical integration taken to the final step, eli<a href="min.htm">min</a>ating the usual late purchase by the consumer.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so this removes one of the reasons we <a href="need.htm">need</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, but what about <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
We trade <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> to sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ialize without barter.<br/>
<br/>
The simple difference of making these trades early in time resolves the usual coincidence of wants problem b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause we are thereby able to sort-out the <a href="chain.htm">chain</a>-of-exchange before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins.<br/>
<br/>
At a high level we are saying you can "pick <a href="future.htm">future</a> Apples" in exchange for "<a href="future.htm">future</a> Oranges" and "<a href="future.htm">future</a> dental <a href="work.htm">work</a>" and "<a href="future.htm">future</a> housing", etc.<br/>
<br/>
This trade one sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ialization <small>(picking Apples)</small> for many finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts requires many other sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ializations, which is the lower-bound on the complexity and scale of each MVV.<br/>
<br/>
Now, obviously the Apple picker does not have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in all of those things starting on Day_1, so there is a "vesting period" that begins when the Apple picker begins <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and continues until they <a href="own.htm">own</a> enough of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the Oranges they want.<br/>
<br/>
B<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause the Apple picker is <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing both to compensate all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers it takes to deliver the many goods and services he will <a href="need.htm">need</a> *and* to gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, they must do extra <a href="work.htm">work</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the extra Apples which will then be sold to 'outsiders' for a <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, and part of that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is used to <a href="recur.htm">recur</a>sively purchase the entire supply-<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e enough Oranges for that Apple picker.<br/>
<br/>
This also means the DAO must hold enough <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, Apple trees, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s, etc. required to make even more Apples than those requested by those within that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 'temporary' requirement that is eventually <a href="min.htm">min</a>imized as each supply-<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> comes under <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those customers, but will usually not be eli<a href="min.htm">min</a>ated completely since people change their <a href="min.htm">min</a>ds about what they want, and so will keep changing which supply-<a href="chain.htm">chain</a>s they <a href="need.htm">need</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in.<br/>
<br/>
We commit <a href="future.htm">Future</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(sign <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s)</small> to pay for the <a href="future.htm">Future</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s)</small> and gain <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, etc. <small>(<a href="source_title.htm">Source_Title</a>s)</small> to ensure the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion we <a href="need.htm">need</a> without paying <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, rent or interest.<br/>
<br/>
Implementation<br/>
We could, theoretically, do all of this "on paper" in a series of multi-locked boxes s<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>urely <a href="chain.htm">chain</a>ed together to form a physical block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought experiment is valuable in clarifying the simplicity of <br/>
<br/>
More likely, we could create a <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> web by each agreeing to host the encrypted data of others in <a href="return.htm">RETURN</a> for them hosting ours, but for now we have started an implementation at <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/TheKinDAO.">github.com/TheKinDAO.</a><br/>
Notes<br/>
"Pre-Allocating" goods and services in this way allows us to achieve full sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ialization and<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomy-of-scale without late barter.<br/>
This reorders<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomic <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>actions to safely reduce debt, rent, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
When occupiers <a href="own.htm">own</a>, rent is no more.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="work to own.htm">work to own</a>,<br/>
and you <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="for product.htm">For Product</a>,<br/>
you <a href="own.htm">own</a> your <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="bread.htm">bread</a>🍞<br/>
before the seeds🌾 are s<a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> requires Users gain access to the virtual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the payer's investment causes Users to gain access to the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> which causes control to be distributed to those who <a href="need.htm">need</a> the results of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <small>(incidentally)</small> also causes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to approach zero as those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are no longer purchased late, but have been "pre-allocated" to the Users who intend to consume them.<br/>
