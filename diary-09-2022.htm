defining the rightful <a href="private.htm">private</a> use of <a href="land.htm">land</a> in the market becomes a<br/>
question of defining our right to exist. If we’ve deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ed that every<br/>
<a href="human.htm">human</a> has an equal right to exist then our <a href="property.htm">property</a> model for <a href="land.htm">land</a><br/>
should reflect that. We propose a competitive common <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
system autonomously ad<a href="min.htm">min</a>istered using block<a href="chain.htm">chain</a> technology.<br/>

economically incentivizing efficient <a href="land.htm">land</a> use while also providing a<br/>
community member dividend.<br/>
<br/>
Introduction<br/>
Community <a href="org.htm">org</a>anizations <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing physical <a href="property.htm">property</a> will often rely on a voting process to<br/>
deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>e how the <a href="property.htm">property</a> can be used and by whom. The problem with this approach<br/>
is a misalignment of incentives and a lack of personal accountability. There’s no real<br/>
costs or risks involved in casting a vote. An elected board or voting majority can easily<br/>
externalize most, if not all the costs and risks of their decisions on the remainder of the<br/>
community. If the majority votes to cancel rent for example, it's the <a href="min.htm">min</a>ority <a href="group.htm">group</a> of<br/>
real estate inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s that will bear the cost. Voting with one's <a href="own.htm">own</a> wallet on the other<br/>
hand is perfectly suited to economic choices by placing all decision making power in the<br/>
hands of those with skin in the game and the best track record of efficient capital<br/>
allocation.<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
<br/>
We propose an <a href="open.htm">open</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> protocol that applies a perpetual <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent for the <a href="private.htm">private</a><br/>
use of community re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es through a competitive <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership bidding process. Below<br/>
we’ll outline the market mechanisms that could be used in such a system to<br/>
continuously and efficiently manage and expand the stock of community re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es<br/>
autonomously and free from <a href="private.htm">private</a> or political capture.<br/>
<br/>
Acquisition<br/>
<a href="land.htm">Land</a> is acquired using a real estate crowdfunding platform. Anyone can use the<br/>
platform and launch a campaign to raise funds to purchase <a href="property.htm">property</a>. If successfully<br/>
funded, the real estate is purchased and the public <a href="land.htm">land</a> title is <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>ferred to the<br/>
community's legal entity. <a href="property.htm">Property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership defaults to the campaign creator and their<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the form of an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er NFT <small>(non-fungible token)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership<br/>
Very little about real estate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <a href="need.htm">need</a>s to change under a competitive common<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership model. The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er would have full <a href="private.htm">private</a> control of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> and pay an<br/>
annual assessment similar to a <a href="property.htm">property</a> tax. Only the method of assessment would<br/>
change. Rather than a government assessment, the market would assess the value by<br/>
taking offers every 12 months. The new assessed value is the highest bid.<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is free to accept or reject the offers. If no action is taken, the highest bid is<br/>
accepted with the annual <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent being paid as part of the <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>action similar to a<br/>
sellers fee. Otherwise the current <a href="own.htm">own</a>er can reject the offers by paying the newly<br/>
assessed annual <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent which is a fixed percentage of the highest bid. The<br/>
process repeats each year and the annual <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent may rise or fall based on the<br/>
market while the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is also free to sell at any time in between.<br/>
<br/>
Improvement<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers have all the standard incentives to improve their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties. Of course, it can be<br/>
expected that annual <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent will put d<a href="own.htm">own</a>ward pressure on sale prices similar to<br/>
high <a href="property.htm">property</a> tax areas.<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
<br/>
While there are no exemptions from the <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent there’s an important caveat. The<br/>
<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent exists to provide a community dividend. If the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is a member of the<br/>
community their dividend will be offsetting. This means that <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent only begins to<br/>
take effect when an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er finds themselves in the upper 50th percen<a href="tile.htm">tile</a> of <a href="property.htm">property</a><br/>
users. Or in other words, it kicks in when the total value of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> under their<br/>
personal control exceeds that of the average member. Conversely, anyone controlling<br/>
less real estate value than average would see their <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent completely covered or<br/>
exceeded by their annual dividend.<br/>
<br/>
Use<br/>
Typically, <a href="property.htm">property</a> zoning and density fall under the jurisdiction of the local government.<br/>
The sovereignty of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er runs up against the will of the people in<br/>
government form, or at least that’s the rationale. As discussed earlier, the result is<br/>
unaccountable voting power being <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>stituted for rational economic calculation.<br/>
A much better approach would be a level playing field where both sides have equal skin<br/>
in the game. The <a href="property.htm">property</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er could retain sovereignty to the extent that they are<br/>
willing to pay the annually assessed <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent. Any opposing parties would have an<br/>
equal opportunity to do the same by offering a bid. They will either succeed in taking<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the <a href="property.htm">property</a> or raise the current occupants' <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent as compensation<br/>
for the undesired use.<br/>
<br/>
With neither side able to strong arm the other, communities can physically self <a href="org.htm">org</a>anize.<br/>
Infrastructure and public space could all be competitively provided by <a href="private.htm">private</a> builders.<br/>
Cities can be designed bottom-up by the market without <a href="need.htm">need</a> for a central planner<br/>
regulating what gets built and where.<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
<br/>
While the system imposes no top d<a href="own.htm">own</a> regulation it’s important to note that members<br/>
are still <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>ject to the overriding laws of the local jurisdiction which may include building<br/>
and zoning regulation. The community is free to <a href="org.htm">org</a>anize and push back against any<br/>
restrictions not providing value or buy <a href="land.htm">land</a> in less restrictive areas.<br/>
<br/>
Membership<br/>
Membership can and should be <a href="open.htm">open</a> and free to everyone. The sole requirement would<br/>
be an identity verification process to ensure one dividend per member. Each member is<br/>
entitled to one equal share of all real estate <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent as a member dividend.<br/>
Initially, the member dividend maximum will <a href="need.htm">need</a> to be artificially pegged to the US<br/>
average home value index. This will simulate an asset-to-member ratio on par with the<br/>
broader US real estate market and allow members to invest in real estate without a<br/>
concern that a membership increase will reduce their dividend offset. Eventually the<br/>
ratio of real estate asset value per member will either match or exceed the artificial peg<br/>
and the dividend will become fully equalized amongst members. Until that point the peg<br/>
provides market parity for real estate acquisition and development. Members would be<br/>
able to market their <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent offsets to inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s up to their individual dividend<br/>
maximum.<br/>
<br/>
Incentive<br/>
By simply applying an annual market assessed <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent to <a href="land.htm">land</a> use we are able to<br/>
disengage <a href="private.htm">private</a> and state monopoly control and bring <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership fully into the<br/>
competitive <a href="land.htm">land</a>scape. The consumer preference for a certain parcel of <a href="land.htm">land</a> is then<br/>
quantifiable in the broader market context and can be measured against alternative<br/>
uses.<br/>
<br/>
Competition can drive all re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to their highest and best use while compensating<br/>
the community for their monopolization. Real estate uses with broader member<br/>
participation will be economically favored due to the <a href="group.htm">group</a>s larger aggregate dividend<br/>
offset. For example, it would be much more expensive for a <a href="private.htm">private</a> park <a href="own.htm">own</a>er to keep<br/>
the entire <a href="property.htm">property</a> to themselves than to <a href="open.htm">open</a> it up for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
<br/>
Upgrade<br/>
For purposes of system upgrades, changes, or its full eli<a href="min.htm">min</a>ation, 100% inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a><br/>
consensus would be required. Fortunately, no voting process would be <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed.<br/>
Because the <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent system imposes a cost and fixes the holdout problem, a<br/>
sufficient <a href="group.htm">group</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would be able to apply enough buyout pressure to achieve<br/>
consensus. In the meantime, they would receive compensatory <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent from the<br/>
holdouts until they decide to sell or agree to the new terms.<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
Nations rise and fall based on their ability to manage scarce re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es. The most<br/>
important metric for any economizing <a href="org.htm">org</a>anization should be its re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e efficiency, or<br/>
in other words, its bottomline. The simple mechanism of a market driven <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und rent<br/>
can establish this common language for real estate efficiency while also providing<br/>
community benefit.<br/>
A community system that establishes our shared right to the inherent value of nature<br/>
without inhibiting our <a href="private.htm">private</a> right to enjoy and improve it could completely change the<br/>
standing of the individual in our economy and correct some of our longest standing<br/>
societal ills in the process.'"</span><br/>

We will structure <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion such as <a href="food.htm">food</a>, shelter, basic healthcare, <a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tation, <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>portation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Occupants select <a href="product_ticket.htm">Product_Ticket</a>s to 'vote' on village <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and then 'pay' for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion by signing <a href="work_contract.htm">Work_Contract</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Each village occupant gains unshared, <a href="private.htm">private</a>, excludable <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for their personal space and never pay Rent as they each are on a <a href="work.htm">work</a>-to-<a href="own.htm">own</a> program.<br/>
<br/>
Occupants also gain co-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="group.htm">group</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion used to achieve <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of predictable goods and services, and so do not pay <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, the core of the village will <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erate almost no revenue, but will likely <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erate financial <a href="return.htm">return</a>s by selling surplus to "tourists".<br/>
<br/>
Some of that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> may be used to pay ECORISE, and DAO partners.<br/>
<br/>
Some of that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be invested for the User <small>(tourist)</small> who bought the surplus <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DAO then buys even more <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and slowly vests those Titles to those Users <small>(tourists)</small>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This causes each User to gain the <a href="property.htm">Property</a> required to make the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts they use.<br/>
<br/>
This causes all Users to slowly become <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, which further stablizes the User_<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed 'core'.<br/>
As the core increases in size, there is even more surplus to sell, so even more <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be distributed.<br/>
<br/>
In the theoretical end, once people on Earth live in this way, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> and Rent will only come from missed predictions and new inventions, and even then it is only temporary since those Users will also gain <a href="land.htm">Land</a> Titles <small>(and <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights and <a href="min.htm">min</a>eral rights and other finite things)</small> required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>

Primary aim of developing this instant m<a href="essen.htm">essen</a>ger is to provide privacy which is achieved using cryptography and anonymity using Tor net<a href="work.htm">work</a>. It can be used over Internet and <a href="private.htm">private</a> LAN net<a href="work.htm">work</a>s <small>(without Internet)</small> for instant messaging and file <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>fer with support for <a href="private.htm">private</a> <a href="chat.htm">chat</a>s and <a href="group.htm">group</a> <a href="chat.htm">chat</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Mesh is based on Bit <a href="chat.htm">Chat</a> and is its successor. Mesh takes core ideas from its predecessor and removes a few. Notably, Mesh does not require centralized user registration and provides anonymous profile support using Tor hidden service. It also removes use of BitTorrent trackers for finding peers which was causing issues with Bit <a href="chat.htm">Chat</a> since some ISPs blocking BitTorrent traffic would also block Bit <a href="chat.htm">Chat</a> traffic. Instead, Mesh relies only on Distributed Hash Tables <small>(DHT)</small> for all purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Mesh allows creating both pure p2p and anonymous profiles with support for running multiple profiles concurrently. Both p2p and anonymous profiles are interoperable such that a p2p profile user can connect with an anonymous profile user via Tor Net<a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
With Mesh, there is no meta data <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erated. User identifier is designed in such a way that it can be changed anytime to hide identity. Since, there is no user registration, we don't know who uses Mesh or how many people use it. In p2p mode, the connections use IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity directly to connect with peers without any server in between. With anonymous mode, all connectivity occurs over Tor net<a href="work.htm">work</a> and uses Tor hidden service to accept inbound connections.'"</span><br/>

<span class="quot2">"'<br/>
Cryptocurrency exchanges are vital for the circulation and trading of cryptocurrencies and without the availability of a particular currency on an exchange, users could not be able to obtain it or liquidate their holdings of the currency when they require. For a cryptocurrency, not being listed on a cryptocurrency exchange is a major hindrance as then it no longer remains a potential purchase option for anyone who was not able to obtain it during the ICO. Users may even not take apart for a token in an ICO if it is not listed on an exchange as they desire the ability to change their cryptocurrency to any other asset, based on market conditions. It is also <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial for them to be able to change their cryptocurrency into fiat currencies as not all <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>actions are possible through cryptocurrencies.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, listing on a cryptocurrency exchange is crucial to the acceptability of a cryptocurrency and its functioning.<br/>
<br/>
How can I get listed on a cryptocurrency exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Considering the importance of listing for any cryptocurrency, it is crucial for cryptocurrencies to know the path for listing on a cryptocurrency exchange. This process involves the following key steps:<br/>
<br/>
The first step is communication with a preferred cryptocurrency exchange about a potential for listing on the exchange. It is <a href="essen.htm">essen</a>tial that a thorough evaluation is made on the back<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und of the exchange and its functioning. The key parameters which are often discussed are:<br/>
<br/>
a)</small> Whether the exchange operates in the countries where you want the circulation of your cryptocurrency?<br/>
b)</small> Does the exchange allow conversion from fiat currency to cryptocurrency or only between cryptocurrencies?<br/>
c)</small> Whether the exchange is centralized or decentralized?<br/>
d)</small> The listing fees charged by the exchange<br/>
e)</small> The technical details of the token and the platform<br/>
<br/>
Considering the complexity of the issues to be considered in the listing process, it is highly recommended that token issuers should approach a professional who has experience in the token listing process. The professional can assist in narrowing d<a href="own.htm">own</a> on potential exchanges for listing and simplify the application process for listing.<br/>
<br/>
In the next step, the exchange through the professional communicates a list of documents that would be required for the listing process. Normally, the professional arranges documents such as legal memorandum on behalf of the token issuer. Empire Global has an in-house team of legal experts who have expertise in the legal evaluation of the compatibility of a Token with the existing legal frame<a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The third step involves the filling up and filing of the application form along with the required documentation and fee. After the filing process is complete, the professional will <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>erally followup on your behalf to understand the progress of the application process.<br/>
<br/>
If the application is accepted, the final stage involves the technological integration of the token with the exchange and arrangement of the payment process for issuance of new tokens and any <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>fer of an additional fee for listing.<br/>
<br/>
What are the documentation requirements for listing on an exchange?<br/>
<br/>
The documentation requirements for listing on a cryptocurrency exchange can vary depending on the exchange and the token which is sought to be listed. The exact requirements will normally be communicated by the professional that you have engaged to assist in the listing process.<br/>
<br/>
The following documents are required in the listing process:<br/>
<br/>
a)</small> Information about the Token issuer and the entire team involved<br/>
b)</small> The problem that the token seeks to resolve<br/>
c)</small> The technological back<a href="gro.htm">gro</a>und and the platform where it is used<br/>
d)</small> The utility of the Token<br/>
e)</small> Current status of the platform and the token<br/>
f)</small> Legal memorandum from a qualified legal professional about the compatibility of the token with the existing legal frame<a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(it is arranged by Empire Global)</small><br/>
g)</small> The Whitepaper and the ICO process<br/>
h)</small> Information about any regulatory action<br/>
