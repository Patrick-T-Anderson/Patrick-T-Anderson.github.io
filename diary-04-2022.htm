<br/>
As commodities began to be exchanged for currency,<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomic thinkers have constantly been trying to d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ipher how <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es are deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Intrinsic theory of value<br/>
Main article: Intrinsic theory of value<br/>
According to the intrinsic theory of value <small>(also called "theory of obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive value")</small>, intrinsic value characterizes—in terms of the value—that something has “in itself”, or “its <a href="own.htm">own</a> sake”, or “in its <a href="own.htm">own</a> right”. It is an express to a concept other than the one just discussed. It is the value that an entity has in itself as well, for what it is, or as an end.<small>[3]</small> This value is not physical; saying that this value is physical is the same as saying our <a href="min.htm">min</a>ds are physical. The value does not exist as an obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t, but is the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties of an obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t.<small>[4]</small><br/>
<br/>
The value is created through the valuer’s attitude or judgements. Moral judgement and d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>isions is a crucial part in this value. Intrinsic value actually cuts off our logical d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ision and makes us think only about what feels right to us, not anybody else b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause it is what we make it to be. If something has intrinsic value it has <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties or features in virtue of which it is valuable, separated of anyone's attitudes or judgements. It includes other variables such as brand name, trademarks, and copyrights that are usually difficult to calculate and sometimes not accurately refl<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ted in the market <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e. Intrinsic value is not what the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are willing to pay; however, it is what the obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t is really worth?<small>[5]</small><br/>
<br/>
Labor theory of value<br/>
Main article: Labor theory of value<br/>
See also: Cost-of-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion theory of value<br/>
In classical<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics, the labor theory of value asserts that the<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomic value of a good or service is deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ed by the total amount of socially n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary labor required to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it. When speaking in terms of a labor theory of value, value without any qualifying adj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theoretically refers to the amount of labor n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of a marketable commodity, including the labor n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary for the development of any capital used in the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion process. Both David <a href="ricard.htm">Ricard</a>o and Karl Marx attempted to quantify and embody all labor components in order to develop a theory of the real, or natural, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of a commodity.<small>[6]</small><br/>
<br/>
In either case, what is being addressed are <a href="gen.htm">gen</a>eral <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es—i.e., <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es in the aggregate, not a sp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ific <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of a particular good or service in a given circumstance. Theories in either class allow for deviations when a particular <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e is struck in a real-world market <a href="trans.htm">trans</a>action, or when a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e is set in some <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e fixing regime.<br/>
<br/>
Exchange theory of value<br/>
In Marxian<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics, the exchange theory of value,<small>[7]</small> is a de<a href="scrip.htm">scrip</a>tion of the dual contrary nature of the labor contained in the commodity. The commodity has at the same time, both a <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive material use value and an obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive exchange value or social value.<small>[8]</small><br/>
<br/>
The use value is the value of a material by the utility, use or consumption, and in which a thing meets <a href="human.htm">human</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<small>[9]</small> An example of this is if someone wants to build a wooden shed they would <a href="need.htm">need</a> a certain quantity and quality of wood and nails. Some use value takes no effort to attain, for example sunlight, or something like gravity both which <a href="human.htm">human</a>s <a href="need.htm">need</a> to survive but do not <a href="need.htm">need</a> to do anything to obtain and still have value. Other use values do require effort to attain, increasing their use value. The <a href="need.htm">need</a>s an obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t fulfills and the physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties, as in the uses to which the obj<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>t can be put to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on, also tie in with the use value.<small>[10]</small><br/>
<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>tary theory of value<br/>
See also: Value-form<br/>
Critics of traditional Marxian<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics, esp<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ially those associated with the Neue Marx-Lektüre <small>(New Readings of Marx)</small> such as Michael Heinrich, emphasize a <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary theory of value, where "<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y is the n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary form of appearance of value <small>(and of capital)</small> in the sense that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es constitute the only form of appearance of the value of commodities."<small>[11]</small> Similarly to the exchange theory, this theory emphasizes value as being socially deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ed, rather than having a physical <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>stance.<br/>
<br/>
According to this analysis, when <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y incorporates <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion into its M-C-M' circulation, it <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ctions as capital implementing the capitalist relation and the exploitation of labor power constitutes the actual presupposition for this incorporation.<small>[12]</small><br/>
<br/>
Power theory of value<br/>
Radical institutional<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler <small>(2009)</small> argue that it was never possible to separate<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics from politics.<small>[13]</small> This separation is required to allow for neoclassical<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics to base their theory on utility value and for Marxists to base the labour theory of value on quantified abstract labour. Instead of a utility theory of value <small>(like neoclassical<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics)</small> or a labour theory of value <small>(as found in Marxian<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics)</small>, Nitzan and Bichler propose a power theory of value. The structure of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es has little to do with the so-called "material" sphere of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and consumption. The quantification of power in <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es is not the consequence of external laws—whether natural or hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ical—but entirely internal to society.<br/>
<br/>
In capitalism, power is the governing principle as rooted in the centrality of <a href="private.htm">private</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. <a href="private.htm">Private</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is wholly and only an act of institutionalized exclusion, and institutionalized exclusion is a matter of <a href="org.htm">org</a>anized power.<small>[14]</small><small>[15]</small> And since the power behind <a href="private.htm">private</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is deno<a href="min.htm">min</a>ated in <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es, Nitzan and Bichler argue, there is a <a href="need.htm">need</a> for a power theory of value. There is, however, a causality dilemma to their argument that has drawn criticism: power is based on the ability of firms to set monopoly <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es yet the ability to set <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es is based on firms possessing a degree of power in the market.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalization, in their theory, is a measure of power, as illu<a href="min.htm">min</a>ated through the present discounted value of <a href="future.htm">future</a> earnings <small>(while also taking into account hype and risk)</small>. This formula is basic to finance which is the overarching logic of capitalism. The logic is also inherently differential as every capitalist strives to accumulate greater earnings than their competitors <small>(but not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> maximization)</small>. Nitzan and Bichler label this process differential accumulation. In order to have a power theory of value there <a href="need.htm">need</a>s to be differential accumulation where some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' rate of <a href="gro.htm">gro</a>wth of capitalization is faster than the average pace of capitalization.<br/>

<a href="sub.htm">Sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value and marginalism<br/>
Main articles: <a href="sub.htm">Sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value and Marginalism<br/>
The <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value is a theory of value that believes that an item’s value depends on the consumer. This theory states that an item’s value is not dependent on the labor that goes into a good, or any inherent <a href="property.htm">property</a> of the good. Instead, the <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value believes that a good’s value depends on the consumers wants and <a href="need.htm">need</a>s.<small>[16]</small> The consumer places a value on an item by deter<a href="min.htm">min</a>ing the marginal utility, or additional satisfaction of one additional good,<small>[17]</small> of that item and d<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>iding what that means to them.<small>[18]</small><br/>
<br/>
The modern <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value was created by William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger in the late 19th century.<small>[19]</small> The <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory contradicted Karl Marx's labor theory which stated an item's value depends on the labour that goes into <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and not the ability to satisfy the consumer.<small>[20]</small><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value helped answer the "diamond–<a href="water.htm">water</a> paradox," which many believed to be unsolvable. The diamond–<a href="water.htm">water</a> paradox questions why diamonds are so much more valuable than <a href="water.htm">water</a> when <a href="water.htm">water</a> is n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary for life. This paradox was answered by the <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value by realizing that <a href="water.htm">water</a>, in total, is more valuable than diamonds b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause the first few units are n<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>essary for life. The key difference between <a href="water.htm">water</a> and diamonds is that <a href="water.htm">water</a> is more plentiful and diamonds are rare. B<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause of the availability, one additional unit of diamonds exceeds the value of one additional unit of <a href="water.htm">water</a>.<small>[20]</small> The <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory is useful for explaining supply and demand.<br/>
<br/>
Marginalism refers to the study of marginal theories and studies within<a href="ec.htm"> ec</a>onomics. The topics included in marginalism are marginal utility, marginal rate of <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>stitution, and opportunity costs.<small>[21]</small> Marginalism can be applied to the <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory of value b<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>ause the <a href="sub.htm">sub</a>j<a href="ec.htm">ec</a>tive theory takes into account the marginal utility of an item in order to put a value on it.<br/>
